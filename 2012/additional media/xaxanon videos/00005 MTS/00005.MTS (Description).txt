Seoul locations for Cicada:3301.

After climbing around a bit I take a second to look around again.  In hindsight, the poster should be easily seen from the GPS coordinates.  Finding the coordinates of the poster was the trick, not seeing it once you get there.  I think it's pretty clear this particular poster was either taken by the person who found it or removed by a park cleaning crew member.
