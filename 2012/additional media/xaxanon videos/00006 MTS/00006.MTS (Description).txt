Seoul locations for Cicada:3301.

Standing directly where the GPS coordinates point to, I do a bit of panning.  Something I noticed afterward is that the second pillar I point to actually did have some packing tape on the rainwater drainage pipe going down its side.  The tape was roughly the dimensions of a piece of paper.  I'm thinking that's where the poster was originally.  However, the poster at Banghwa was only taped up by the corners using scotch tape, so maybe I missed something.  I'll go back there in a few days and dig around a little more.  A thought I had after getting home was that perhaps there's a common theme of bicycles in the areas, seeing as there was a bike parking area underneath the highway overpass to the left of the grey fence between the pillars.
