Seoul locations for Cicada:3301.

Here's where I think the poster was taped up at the Yongsan location.  It seems kind of odd that a cleaning crew would take the poster but leave the tape... though it does make sense if someone who found the poster and took it left the tape (seeing as that's what I did at Banghwa:p).  This style of taping seems more in line with what the other photos of posters showed.
