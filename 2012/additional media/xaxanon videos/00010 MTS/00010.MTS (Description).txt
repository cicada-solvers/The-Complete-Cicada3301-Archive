Seoul locations for Cicada:3301.

Quick observations about the two locations.

Yongsan: minutes from Seobinggo exit 2 which also had a parking lot, many bike paths and bike parking, pedestrian foot paths nearby, a water taxi, and a small skate park.  Furthermore, across the street to the north of the area are apartments similar in style to the Banghwa ones I believe (that in itself is nothing special.  These boxy apartments are all over Korea).

Banghwa: Right outside of the subway, bicycle access is definitely doable, a parking area is right next to the exit, and it's two stops away from Gimpo Int'l airport.
