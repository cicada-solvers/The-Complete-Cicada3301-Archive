1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,990
by the way it might not be nothing there

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:09,830
might be nothing but dog eyes some guys

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,500
through the Nova wiki in the IRC chat I

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,690
mentioned 404 being funny as the area

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,539
code in Atlanta

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:19,829
notice that symbol above the 404 here

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,769
and at the other location there were

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,448
three peace symbols graffiti done to one

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,489
of the V pillars supporting the overhead

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,840
pass didn't think anything of it at the

11
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,439
time they weren't connected they're on

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,920
different surfaces but three P symbols

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:40,019
three circles they weren't joined but

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,780
three circles are who knows anyway yeah

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:47,940
me now and here in relation to where

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,460
this page was it's pretty much you can

17
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,738
see framed I don't know fine means

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,489
nothing if I was right about the other

19
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:58,500
location where the flyer was then it had

20
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,698
your back was to the peace symbols so I

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,460
don't know if it means anything but you

22
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,929

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,790

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,770
