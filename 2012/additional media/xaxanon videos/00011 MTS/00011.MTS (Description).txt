Seoul locations for Cicada:3301.

Talking to some of the people in the wiki.n0v4 IRC chat, someone mentioned that 404 was the area code for Atlanta.  Something was also mentioned 404 being written in 8 ft letters somewhere (I was chatting on my iPhone and it annoying kept scrolling to the top randomly so I couldn't follow the conversation very well).  Funny how the Samhwa apartment complex #404 has it's number written in 8 ft tall characters here as well.

Probably nothing, but what the hell.  Perhaps there's some correlation between the different locations?

Also of red herring note, the symbol above the 404 on the side of the building: 3 joined circles.  At Yongsan there were 4 graffiti peace symbols, though on different surfaces.
