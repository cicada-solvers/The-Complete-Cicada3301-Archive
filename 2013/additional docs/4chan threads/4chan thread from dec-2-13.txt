    Don't bother bro. If the dude in the story took ten days and I passed him in a couple hours, you have no chance.

    Nice try.

    It was a series of images. Each of us had our own codes. They ran in parallel series.

    Hint: John Smith.

    Smith was an early American colonial mayor, he was captured by a nearby Indian in a show of power. A ceremony in which Smith was lead to believe he was going to be killed was "stopped" by the chieftain's daughter. She "saved" his life. He was later informed of the trick. It was a show of power and of dominance, but also of goodwill.

    The cicada is live, and the rounds are restarting. I was spit out but I got far enough.

    The grocery store and Midnight show was them?
    For what purpose was it necessary to do those things?
    I know who this is, I haven't read their agenda however.

    How far did either of you get in?

    It all looks to be true, but look at the last paragraph. This is utterly too convenient. They would know that we would find this. If this were truly a lone dissident, he wouldn't post anything of this sort in this manner. Then again, he might post this expecting that possible 3301 recruits would find it using the same intuition which would earn them membership. I think it's a trap because it's too convenient, but it may be something more valid.

    Yehovah, Adonai, look out for these.

    I remember Adonai from Hebrew school. Also, YY. It's an English transliteration of how "God" was spelled in Hebrew in Jewish books because it was considered unholy to print God's name. Adonai is how it was pronounced aloud in prayer.

    It's not quite clear, you guys can call if you want

    FF001 is only heard at the end of this message

    what if the message wasn't intended to be listened to all the way through

    that everyone would hear the beginning and hang up, or listen all the way and not question the code, thinking its standard?


    Just thinking.

    Well OP, you know shit compared to me, how about you get on my level? Ever heard of Quantum Computing? No? Well, to show you how pathetic you are I will save you the straining effort of Googleing that shit so you don't go into cardiac arrest.

    Quantum computing is the shit. Hardly anybody has mastered that, but when you do, holy fuck it opens a new realm of exploration. And i'm not shitting your fuck. This is used by the top government officials and secret agencies such as the Freemasons highest members to transfer such delicate material that if it was to go public, it would cause worldwide riots. I cannot begin to explain the amount of creepy shit on there, tests on children, videos supporting popular conspiracy theorists, and even schematics on weapons that could only be described as something from an R18 horror. I would spill the beans for your faggot ass OP but quite frankly, I value my life so I will stay put. You wanna know what I saw, then you gotta learn the shit you fucking faggot.

    No one made a puzzle this complex for the fuck of it. They're clearly recruiting for something bigger than we all can even conceive here and that's probably why its so fucking complex. They don't want any old dipshit stumbling on this. Chances are the people who cracked this puzzle are either members of the organization or dead right now.

    Pretty much some random gov't/organization posted OP's pic in 4chan awhile ago and it leads to some long sequence of things that must be hacked in order to get to some solution. Looks like only a very very select few can get this. Even adept hackers appear to be having trouble. Could be a gov't/organization recruiting for some big mission. Could be a huge fucking troll. No one really knows.

    Event horizon of a Mandelbrot fractal refers to a black hole. I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the movie, and the name Maximillian. Or perhaps the phrase "In, Through and Beyond"

    so if its a black hole, the event horizon refers to "the point of no return" when even light can't escape. the mandelbrot set "refers to the points in the complex plane that never reach escape velocity during the iteration process" ideas?

    okay i thought so. excerpt from CloseToTheEdge http://www.butterflyeffect.ca/FractalCosmology/CloseToTheEdge.pdf
    The Mandelbrot Set is a universe in it's own right. It is a perfect example of bounded infinity. The M-set curve is an infinitely complex one dimensional curve that is bounded in two dimensions. It is technically a bounded boundless boundary. This is the boundary that seperates INSIDE points (blue) from OUTSIDE points (black). It could be thought of as a horizon, and in my model, is analogous to the event horizon of a black hole

    Of course, you realize that everything Cicada 3301 has ever done was all signed by the same GPG key, right?

    Is whatever hint you fags are working on signed with it? If not, I wouldn't waste my time.

    and are you outguessing the images? Did you read any of it?

    Wasn't there a series of "WE ARE COMING" images going around a few months ago? Or maybe, "WE ARE EVERYWHERE?"

    Something about January 13th or something, put on dollar bills?

    Never saved the pics, didn't care to.

    Cicada is the root of Anon. Or, rather, it created Anon as one of many ways to effect change.

    Many people took it upon themselves to become Anon as well, and this was intended. The idea was to engender widespread, spontaneous action to undermine a corrupt system.

    It also creates a distraction so the "inner circle" that birthed Anon can more easily affect the system in other ways. They needed skilled, highly intelligent people. To help them out.

    They're fighting the good fight and they see things as they are.

    just got an idea, you know how those lines and numbers corresponding to verses in Agrippas poem go?
    They are pretty similar to lines of code.
    33:01 would 33rd line 1st letter etc.
    Maybe in all the mess of clues there is but a code that can give us something more.

    opening the image in notepad and looking at the bottom of the text reveals "TIBERIVS CLAVDIVS CAESAR says "lxxt>33m2mqkyv2gsq3q=w]O2ntk"" (without the outer quotes). Putting this through a Ceasar cipher (shifting the ascii value of each character by 4, because he was the 4th emperor) produces the following: http://i.imgur.com/m9sYK.jpg, which links to a common picture of a duck decoy and states that you can't figure it out.

    Be reminded of the P.S.

    Cicada is always looking for people to join them if they have been hinting, most probable is that Cicada might be lurking here on /b/ to see if some individuals are intelligent enough to crack their code, for my experience on why i've said that, /b/ is an underground for people with vast amount of knowledge & high IQ even though with all those racist, gay, /b/ like posts here.

    I can also connect the term coined here 'hivemind' which also coordinates with the 3301/Cicada's belief of "Global Mind"

    I wouldn't go over to find out now, using a little bit of wisdom, Cicada might be a dangerous group to deal with and I still want a family because I'm still 18

    They say they don't do anything illegal.
    And I'm not of your opinion.
    I have no "morality", like many people here on /b/
    Everything is senseless to me, but still we have to live, so let's live how we like to

    Around the P.S. part

    and besides, aren't any of you curious on how OP is still aware of the date when 3301, started, I mean It's almost a year and I already forgot about that

    Nope. It's too bad everyone forgot about this. Operation failed already; nobody is spreading this anymore.
