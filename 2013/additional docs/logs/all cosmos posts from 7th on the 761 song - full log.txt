[2013-01-07 00:01:27] <scrounger> CheeseFingers: the twitter account number, not whatever you think i'm referring to
[2013-01-07 00:01:38] <Cooper_> I'l take another dump of the tweets once it gets to 464

[2013-01-07 00:01:47] <leakhmskill> alright

[2013-01-07 00:12:47] <Absencelol> Get the prime # for 1033 (as in which prime) I think its 174
[2013-01-07 00:12:51] <bakpak2hvy> 10 MINUTES
[2013-01-07 00:12:52] <bakpak2hvy> ISH
[2013-01-07 00:12:53] <Absencelol> get the 174th tweet and decode that one
[2013-01-07 00:13:12] <leakhmskill> or the prime # for 3011
[2013-01-07 00:13:19] <leakhmskill> or both together
[2013-01-07 00:13:30] <bakpak2hvy> i can grab the 174th
[2013-01-07 00:13:36] <Kashue> what do you mean get the prime #?
[2013-01-07 00:13:38] <bakpak2hvy> but wtf do you mean decode
[2013-01-07 00:13:39] <bakpak2hvy> im lost

[2013-01-07 00:13:53] <bakpak2hvy> 3301 is the 464th prime
[2013-01-07 00:13:59] <bakpak2hvy> we dont have that # tweet yet
[2013-01-07 00:14:01] <bakpak2hvy> actually
[2013-01-07 00:14:14] <iIIustrious> only 2 more to go to it though

[2013-01-07 00:14:46] <Absencelol> i really suggest trying the 174th for the jpeg
[2013-01-07 00:14:50] <Absencelol> before it hits 464
[2013-01-07 00:15:03] <Absencelol> Faster the better?

[2013-01-07 00:27:17] <leakhmskill> my idea is, most tweets are a mess that can't be decoded
[2013-01-07 00:27:30] <leakhmskill> and specific tweets are the ones we are looking for
[2013-01-07 00:27:40] <bakpak2hvy> http://pastebin.archlinux.fr/455157
[2013-01-07 00:27:45] <leakhmskill> and using the hints we have found so far, we get the right tweets
[2013-01-07 00:27:52] <bakpak2hvy> ^data from twitter.jpg someone mentioned earlier
[2013-01-07 00:28:43] <leakhmskill> the twitter will run on forever, but stop spitting out useful tweets, just more stuff we can't decode
[2013-01-07 00:28:54] <leakhmskill> or decodes into nothing

[2013-01-07 00:29:17] <rb9269> how many tweets should we be looking for?
[2013-01-07 00:29:19] <Cooper_> prime numbers?
[2013-01-07 00:29:19] <leakhmskill> I think it has to with the headers
[2013-01-07 00:29:20] <hofstadter> there are 13 digits in the twitter handle and 13 is prime if that helps at all
[2013-01-07 00:29:39] <bakpak2hvy> i think scrounger is having some sort of breakthrough in hackers
[2013-01-07 00:29:41] <bakpak2hvy> or hes high
[2013-01-07 00:29:42] <leakhmskill> we need to use commonalities between from previous steps and hints

[2013-01-07 02:36:04] <Lurker69> no it wasnt 464
[2013-01-07 02:36:16] <Lurker69> i put some things aabout it on wiki
[2013-01-07 02:38:28] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Twitter_is_jpg_theory
[2013-01-07 02:38:52] <Lurker69> i need to  sign up in wiki, that captcha is a$$
[2013-01-07 02:39:04] <Kenodox> i have been scrolling through the wiki and about 5 other related links and I think I am having an epiphany
[2013-01-07 02:39:33] <fasd> do tell
[2013-01-07 02:40:03] <Kenodox> the message: "@1231507051321  The key is all around you.  Good luck.  3301" led us to the twitter, and we need a key to crack the hexadecimal, right?
[2013-01-07 02:40:17] <Kenodox> the riddle says that "the key is all around you"
[2013-01-07 02:40:37] <Kenodox> and quite literally, the music playing during the image boot is all around you!
[2013-01-07 02:40:55] <Kenodox> the wiki says the song was in "g", so maybe the key is g
[2013-01-07 02:41:02] <lulzorz> Kenodox: the twitter isn't encoded, it's just fucked up jpeg
[2013-01-07 02:41:04] <lulzorz> >music played during image boot
[2013-01-07 02:41:05] <lulzorz> lolwat
[2013-01-07 02:41:17] <Absence_> ^
[2013-01-07 02:41:57] <Kenodox> wait no the music was from another file
[2013-01-07 02:41:58] <BlackJesus> do you even cicada?
[2013-01-07 02:41:58] <Kenodox> I got mixed up sorry
[2013-01-07 02:42:04] <Absence_> So what does it mean all round you? Physically or virtually?
[2013-01-07 02:42:18] <BlackJesus> both?
[2013-01-07 02:42:25] <Guest3181> shed our circumferences
[2013-01-07 02:42:26] <BlackJesus> is that possible?
[2013-01-07 02:42:38] <BlackJesus> like a circumscision or something?
[2013-01-07 02:42:48] <Absence_> lol.
[2013-01-07 02:42:49] <fasd> I just put one of the tweets into a packet hexdump decoder and the address said "How"
[2013-01-07 02:42:55] <Guest3181> we are going in circles
[2013-01-07 02:43:01] <BlackJesus> fasd: wat
[2013-01-07 02:43:01] <Guest3181> circumference as in circles
[2013-01-07 02:43:06] <BlackJesus> this might be something
[2013-01-07 02:43:30] <BlackJesus> fasd: what hexdump thing are you using?
[2013-01-07 02:44:16] <Absence_> did anyone markdown the 464th tweet? Want to see what happens when you decode that one.
[2013-01-07 02:44:21] <fasd> http://sadjad.me/phd/
[2013-01-07 02:44:26] <Guest3181> any theories on the divinity within?
[2013-01-07 02:44:49] <Kenodox> yes, the divinity within means the divine ratio, or the golden ratio
[2013-01-07 02:44:55] <fasd> im just throwing shit in there and looking at what pops out
[2013-01-07 02:45:03] <Kenodox> or at least that was the general consensus last night
[2013-01-07 02:45:21] <c4_> Which tweet did you put into it?
[2013-01-07 02:46:24] <fasd> cant remember sorry
[2013-01-07 02:46:36] <BlackJesus> pick a random one and do it again
[2013-01-07 02:46:37] <c4_> No worries
[2013-01-07 02:46:41] <BlackJesus> i cant use this thing to save my life
[2013-01-07 02:46:51] <Absence_> i'm doing a lot of them
[2013-01-07 02:46:57] <Absence_> wait
[2013-01-07 02:47:00] <Absence_> isnt there a paste of

[2013-01-07 02:47:04] <Absence_> all the hex codes?
[2013-01-07 02:48:20] <lulzorz> https://pastee.org/w9gnc <-- that's all of them in b64
[2013-01-07 02:48:20] <Kenodox> do the very first tweet
[2013-01-07 02:48:32] <lulzorz> you can decode that and hexdump it if you want
[2013-01-07 02:48:37] =-= BlackJesus is now known as bak|afk
[2013-01-07 02:48:38] <fasd> i found that if i decode the tweet from ASCII to hex then but it in the packet decoder thing i normaly get some weird stuff
[2013-01-07 02:48:41] <Cooper_> Fuck. Can't even focus on work stuff. I need a nap.

[2013-01-07 02:57:37] <Lesmo> Ok, mates. Been on this all the freakin' day. Guess we're al just going random.
[2013-01-07 02:57:48] <fasd> why in the hell did i get that?
[2013-01-07 02:58:07] <Lesmo> ... what's with the flexus thing?
[2013-01-07 02:58:36] <Kenodox> and also, IEEE 802.3 is ethernet, which is an internet protocol
[2013-01-07 02:58:41] <fasd> I took the tweet "b6adc7315efff8ee8b1f4d9770c59cebb231f33a246d1afaa9f77aa0342c375f746c42c9796c45d3c3455e4983c0596d9125839ee82c02a6694c8de9b0e1840130" and decoded it from ASCII to hex
[2013-01-07 02:59:09] <Lesmo> ... what??
[2013-01-07 02:59:16] <Lesmo> You mean the other way around?
[2013-01-07 03:00:00] <fasd> took that hex "00 06 93 08 08 01 04 2a 3b e7 21 f6 01 09 4d 56 77 ea 2a 44 2d 03 7f 77 54 cf 52 02 26 08 09 00 02" and put it in here http://sadjad.me/phd/

[2013-01-07 03:02:09] <Lesmo> uhm... I guess that is... wrong
[2013-01-07 03:02:13] <Lesmo> ... or just?
[2013-01-07 03:02:17] <Lesmo> I dunno, gotta go
[2013-01-07 03:02:34] <fasd> did the same thing again and found this "Alphacel"
[2013-01-07 03:02:40] <Kenodox> fasd, i put it through as well, and the EEEI 802.3 part means that it was using ethernet protocols, and the FlexusCo_ part meant that FlexusCo is one of the website hosts it tracked the hex to
[2013-01-07 03:03:35] <fasd> does it make sense to you or am I a raving loon?

[2013-01-07 03:21:52] <c4_> Sorry if this is irrelevant or has been discussed but on https://pastee.org/w9gnc (all the tweets) look at tweets 13, 14, and 15. Notice how similar they are. None of the others seem to share the anything close ot the similarities they do...
[2013-01-07 03:22:08] <Lurker69> but you have all thelinks images and tekst you could need in pastebin
[2013-01-07 03:22:29] <bak|afk> cani just copypasta it? i skimmed it and it all looks important to me

[2013-01-07 03:25:46] <Lurker69> yes lines are almost the same
[2013-01-07 03:25:48] <immortalghost> my theory n the increase
[2013-01-07 03:26:02] <immortalghost> is that itll keep increasing so we get them all sooner
[2013-01-07 03:26:24] <immortalghost> the 5 mins was just to psych out the weeker people
[2013-01-07 03:26:25] <c4_> That important?
[2013-01-07 03:26:30] <immortalghost> and  get them to leave
[2013-01-07 03:26:39] <c4_> As I can't see it anywhere else in the tweets and hadn't seen it discussed
[2013-01-07 03:26:55] <Absence_> To a prior discussion; we've came up with the theory that all images have a possibility of linking together. Soon they will diminish in difference, but as of yet no one can confirm this.
[2013-01-07 03:27:51] <Lurker69> c4_: also

[2013-01-07 03:33:01] <_antelope_> Anyway, with the amount of tweets we can rule out the possibility that they all carry some coded message

[2013-01-07 03:40:30] <Absence_> If it goes faster then nothing changed but the process speed, unless it has a drastic change from 4 minutes to 10 seconds, we have nothing to worry about. More minds can't hurt; lets just hope they aren't dumb.
[2013-01-07 03:41:10] <_antelope_> I don't know
[2013-01-07 03:41:36] <_antelope_> maybe waiting on the twitter would leave only the dedicated people at the end

[2013-01-07 03:46:08] <Lurker69> i dont see anything similar in lulzorz files
[2013-01-07 03:46:44] <Lurker69> Dafodilianv: that is just random image from my hdd with ()*56789:CDEFGHIJSTUVWXY  in hrader
[2013-01-07 03:46:45] <Dafodilianv>  I had a theory that the tweets might be chess moves
[2013-01-07 03:47:11] <Lurker69> i donr know fow cooper got ()*56789:CDEFGHIJSTUVWXY  from tweets
[2013-01-07 03:47:25] <Absence_> chess moves? describe.
[2013-01-07 03:47:35] <Dafodilianv> One sec, it's a tangent
[2013-01-07 03:47:52] <Lurker69> on the other hand i dont understang hoe that hex ascii utf 8 conversions work at all
[2013-01-07 03:47:53] <_antelope_> chess moves are at least something new to look at
[2013-01-07 03:48:03] <Absence_> a straight like that touches a curve?

[2013-01-07 03:48:46] <Dafodilianv> I don't know if it was followed up, but I mentioned earlier the four digits of 3301/ 1033 pi/phi in the tweets
[2013-01-07 03:48:47] <_antelope_> tangent like offtopic, i believe
[2013-01-07 03:48:53] <leakhmskill> how could it be chess moves?
[2013-01-07 03:48:58] <c4_> There was a thing of wiki for 464 relating to chess
[2013-01-07 03:49:04] <Dafodilianv> Chess moves are also 4 digits
[2013-01-07 03:49:07] <c4_> I think it was total legal moves for a king or somthing
[2013-01-07 03:49:12] <Dafodilianv> from 1-9  to a-f
[2013-01-07 03:49:14] <leakhmskill> oh yeah, 464 legal moves for a king
[2013-01-07 03:49:24] <Dafodilianv> No, chess movoes themselves
[2013-01-07 03:49:26] <leakhmskill> I remember reading that

[2013-01-07 03:49:36] <Dafodilianv> like Kne5
[2013-01-07 03:49:46] <Dafodilianv> from 1-9, e-f, and furthermore
[2013-01-07 03:49:51] <Dafodilianv> examine the wiki link
[2013-01-07 03:49:52] <c4_> So you think this is playing out a chess game?
[2013-01-07 03:50:01] <leakhmskill> anyone good at chess?
[2013-01-07 03:50:04] <Dafodilianv> dunno, it may be referencing moves or figures
[2013-01-07 03:50:13] <Dafodilianv> I am somewhat knowleadgable on it
[2013-01-07 03:50:15] <_antelope_> I know the move syntax

[2013-01-07 03:50:32] <Dafodilianv> But understand, I thought of this after reading a recent wiki article, one of those new trending ones
[2013-01-07 03:50:36] <Dafodilianv> for magnus carlsen
[2013-01-07 03:50:42] <_antelope_> but it's probably just showing up randomly in the hex
[2013-01-07 03:50:45] <leakhmskill> http://www.chesslab.com/PositionSearch.html
[2013-01-07 03:50:46] <Dafodilianv> and chess moves have a lot of primes/0's
[2013-01-07 03:50:47] <Absence_> that would mean the twitter played out 514 moves already
[2013-01-07 03:50:55] <Dafodilianv> Not necessarily
[2013-01-07 03:50:58] <Absence_> you said there is only 464 moves in total.
[2013-01-07 03:51:03] <Dafodilianv> no I didn't
[2013-01-07 03:51:05] <Dafodilianv> wait  a sec
[2013-01-07 03:51:07] <Dafodilianv> look at the link
[2013-01-07 03:51:25] <_antelope_> 464 were the primes from the boot sequence
[2013-01-07 03:51:29] <leakhmskill> I think this will take chess format
[2013-01-07 03:51:31] <Dafodilianv> On 26 April 2004, Carlsen became a Grandmaster at the age of 13 years, 148 days,
[2013-01-07 03:51:33] <leakhmskill> and move the pieces
[2013-01-07 03:51:59] <leakhmskill> does someone have the pastebin of the twitter posts?
[2013-01-07 03:52:05] <leakhmskill> I'd like to start from #1

[2013-01-07 03:52:29] <c4_> If this works...
[2013-01-07 03:53:05] <Dafodilianv> Hold a sec, I have a lot of stuff on this page

[2013-01-07 03:54:26] <leakhmskill> black would have to start first
[2013-01-07 03:54:28] <_antelope_> Dafodilanv: keep going
[2013-01-07 03:54:29] <leakhmskill> to get b6
[2013-01-07 03:54:42] <leakhmskill> which starts the first twitter string
[2013-01-07 03:55:02] <Dafodilianv> Chess is often in sets of four games
[2013-01-07 03:55:22] <Dafodilianv> Look at the page, there's a lot of relations, possibly imagined, but I saw something Instar related ima find
[2013-01-07 03:55:25] <sr01> 500 moves?
[2013-01-07 03:55:29] <sr01> unlikely
[2013-01-07 03:55:57] <leakhmskill> maybe each tweet is a complete game
[2013-01-07 03:56:04] <_antelope_> it may not be a conventional chess game

[2013-01-07 03:56:44] <_antelope_> i doubt each tweet is a game, there would be more variation in text length
[2013-01-07 03:57:02] <leakhmskill> also, the numbers go to 9
[2013-01-07 03:57:11] <leakhmskill> and chess boards are 8x8
[2013-01-07 03:57:15] <leakhmskill> not possible
[2013-01-07 03:57:45] <leakhmskill> and there are massive strings of just numbers, no letters
[2013-01-07 03:58:05] <Dafodilianv>  Peer Gynt Prize - PGP, still have that instar thing to find

[2013-01-07 03:58:34] <_antelope_> ok, so there may be a move hidden inside each separate tweet
[2013-01-07 03:58:57] <leakhmskill> that seems excessive, even for cicada

[2013-01-07 03:59:36] <n00b_> It looks like there are close to the same number of characters in each tweet
[2013-01-07 03:59:41] <Dafodilianv> n the NH Chess Tournament held in Amsterdam in August, Carlsen participated in an "Experience" v "Rising Stars" Scheveningen team match. The "Rising Stars" won the match 22–28,   instars/ rising stars correlates to the theme of emergence

[2013-01-07 03:59:52] <leakhmskill> well, tweets max at 140 characters no matter what
[2013-01-07 04:00:01] <leakhmskill> so they're bound to be similar lengths
[2013-01-07 04:00:28] <scrounger> So... we're talking abut chess instead of trying to solve the JPG thing? Sweet!
[2013-01-07 04:00:46] <leakhmskill> we dropped the jpg thing for now
[2013-01-07 04:00:55] <leakhmskill> trying to find different meanings
[2013-01-07 04:01:02] <_antelope_> we needed a diversion
[2013-01-07 04:01:03] <Dafodilianv> This win, the third time Carlsen had won the tournament in the past four years, increased his rating from 2848 to a new record of 2861, breaking Kasparov's 13-year record of 2851
[2013-01-07 04:01:15] <Dafodilianv> By rating performance, this was one of the best results in history, with a performance rating of 2994
[2013-01-07 04:01:50] <leakhmskill> by the way, to continue my theme of palindromes, cicada is made of two palindromes, cic and ada
[2013-01-07 04:02:00] <_antelope_> ok. . .
[2013-01-07 04:02:10] <n00b_> Sorry, I'm just joinging in. Which .jpg?
[2013-01-07 04:02:12] <Dafodilianv> Hey i've been out of the loop thinkin of shit all day, I just noticed the correlation between the fact we can find relevant four-character parses in the tweets and chess is based around four-character moves and four-character dates
[2013-01-07 04:02:21] <leakhmskill> I'm shooting in the dark here man
[2013-01-07 04:02:27] <Dafodilianv> Also, they gravitate towards primes naturally
[2013-01-07 04:02:37] <leakhmskill> yeah, palindromes and primes
[2013-01-07 04:03:03] <leakhmskill> what is standard chess notation for a random move?
[2013-01-07 04:03:10] <leakhmskill> well, any move
[2013-01-07 04:03:26] <_antelope_> letter followed by number
[2013-01-07 04:03:39] <leakhmskill> in 2 letter or 4 letter groupings?
[2013-01-07 04:03:41] <_antelope_> b6
[2013-01-07 04:03:50] <Dafodilianv> And on the topic of finding clues in the "raw" tweets, we haven't really any external codex to work with, right, and the fact that we found 3301, 1033, pi, and phi, each once and only once, four characters each, must be significant
[2013-01-07 04:03:59] <_antelope_> usually white and black moves are grouped
[2013-01-07 04:04:12] <_antelope_> e4 e5
[2013-01-07 04:04:24] <Dafodilianv> examine these
[2013-01-07 04:04:25] <Dafodilianv> gxf7
[2013-01-07 04:04:26] <leakhmskill> but how do you know what moved to that spot?
[2013-01-07 04:04:32] <Dafodilianv> It's to remove ambiguity and increase flow
[2013-01-07 04:05:04] <leakhmskill> if two pieces could both go to e4, how do you know which one makes the move?
[2013-01-07 04:05:05] <n00b_> The moves couldn't be referencing a specific game, could they?
[2013-01-07 04:05:22] <_antelope_> We can't be sure of exactly what type of chess syntax is being used
[2013-01-07 04:05:41] <scrounger> leakhmskill, that's actually really interesting. i hadn't noticed that before!
[2013-01-07 04:05:48] <Dafodilianv> 18.Ng6 fxg6 19.Qxe6+ Kh8 20.hxg6 Ng8 21.Bxh6 gxh6 22.Rxh6+ Nxh6 23.Qxe7 Nf7 24.gxf7 Kg7 25.Rd3 Rd6 26.Rg3+ Rg6 27.Qe5+ Kxf7 28.Qf5+ Rf6 29.Qd7#
[2013-01-07 04:05:51] <leakhmskill> http://chess.about.com/od/tipsforbeginners/qt/ReadNotation.htm
[2013-01-07 04:05:57] <leakhmskill> interesting read
[2013-01-07 04:05:59] <_antelope_> but if it was like gxf7, wouldn't the x be used disproportionately much?
[2013-01-07 04:06:01] <n00b_> Maybe if we start at the beginning of the game, there would only be one real option for what could move there
[2013-01-07 04:06:11] <leakhmskill> capital letters are the piece
[2013-01-07 04:06:29] <leakhmskill> then, the lower case and number are the square
[2013-01-07 04:06:50] <leakhmskill> pawns don't have capital letters
[2013-01-07 04:07:08] <leakhmskill> X means capturing a piece
[2013-01-07 04:07:25] <Dafodilianv> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation
[2013-01-07 04:07:26] <pr0> so u guys sure this is the tweets?
[2013-01-07 04:07:38] <Dafodilianv>  PGN is used when working with computer chess programs.
[2013-01-07 04:07:51] <n00b_> Ok, so do we just set up a chess board for a new game, then follow the notation?
[2013-01-07 04:07:53] <_antelope_> pic is PGN. . .
[2013-01-07 04:07:55] <leakhmskill> but
[2013-01-07 04:08:08] <leakhmskill> there are no pluses or symbols to indicate checks
[2013-01-07 04:08:11] <leakhmskill> or checkmates
[2013-01-07 04:08:18] <n00b_> What if it isn't the entire game yet?
[2013-01-07 04:08:23] <Dafodilianv> But the moves themselves do
[2013-01-07 04:08:25] <Dafodilianv> If we have a board
[2013-01-07 04:08:29] <_antelope_> it could just be openings. . .
[2013-01-07 04:08:33] <Dafodilianv> and we know the positons
[2013-01-07 04:08:35] <Dafodilianv> then we know the game
[2013-01-07 04:08:59] <leakhmskill> okay, but there are long strings of numbers, then strings of letters
[2013-01-07 04:09:13] <n00b_> So... anyone have a chess board? I can probably find one online
[2013-01-07 04:09:22] <_antelope_> Yes, not everything is a move
[2013-01-07 04:09:23] <Dafodilianv> Minimal algebraic notation (MAN) is similar to SAN but omits the indicators for capture ("x") and check ("+"). It was used by Chess Informant.
[2013-01-07 04:09:31] <leakhmskill> I don't think it is chess
[2013-01-07 04:09:40] <Dafodilianv> Yes, I have a chessboard, I am going to sit back, blaze a bowl, and investigate further
[2013-01-07 04:09:51] <Dafodilianv> also man/ manu, which is a tournament
[2013-01-07 04:09:59] <leakhmskill> we can try MAN, it seems to be the cloest, but I don't think chess had anyting to do with it
[2013-01-07 04:10:04] <_antelope_> ^ this man is doing it right
[2013-01-07 04:10:31] <Dafodilianv> I'm just glad I can articulate my theories in a way they're slightly plausible
[2013-01-07 04:10:59] <Dafodilianv> But what was the jpg thing? 'cause I didn't get an answer on that
[2013-01-07 04:11:24] <_antelope_> We are on an anonymous message board discussing an almost impossible theory
[2013-01-07 04:11:35] <_antelope_> An no one gives a fuck how stupid it might sound
[2013-01-07 04:11:46] <_antelope_> but we just keep going
[2013-01-07 04:11:50] <Dafodilianv> Everything cicada related is implausible and nigh-impossible
[2013-01-07 04:11:54] <leakhmskill> welcome to the internet
[2013-01-07 04:12:19] <pr0> whatever it is its only going to be solved using coding
[2013-01-07 04:12:22] <_antelope_> I love you guys

[2013-01-07 04:17:11] <Dafodilianv> an example:
[2013-01-07 04:17:19] <Dafodilianv> e2e4 e7e5
[2013-01-07 04:17:29] <n00b_> It is
[2013-01-07 04:17:33] <leakhmskill> 761 is a prime
[2013-01-07 04:17:53] <c4_> Sounding good daf
[2013-01-07 04:17:59] <n00b_> Should we be keeping an eye out for other numbers showing up on that list hen?
[2013-01-07 04:18:05] <leakhmskill> who is working on the chess stuff?
[2013-01-07 04:18:28] <Dafodilianv> Me
[2013-01-07 04:18:33] <Dafodilianv> Should I go to riddler?
[2013-01-07 04:18:34] <Dafodilianv> Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a plain text computer-processible format for recording chess games (both the moves and related data), supported by many chess programs.

[2013-01-07 04:20:02] <leakhmskill> but we could explore the ches idea
[2013-01-07 04:20:16] <leakhmskill> although I have no idea how chess does anything for us

[2013-01-07 04:20:43] <Absence_> It doesn't seem like cicada would go to chess
[2013-01-07 04:21:08] <c4_> Why not?
[2013-01-07 04:21:16] <pr0> seems like a jpg
[2013-01-07 04:21:22] <fasd> it could also be some sort of authentication
[2013-01-07 04:21:23] <n00b_> I don't know about you, but I havn't seen why they wouldn't
[2013-01-07 04:22:00] <leakhmskill> I say we let hackers handle the jpg

[2013-01-07 04:23:49] <leakhmskill> not that I can see
[2013-01-07 04:24:01] <n00b_> I'm not sure. The fact it isn't prime makes me doubt it, but maybe
[2013-01-07 04:24:18] <Dafodilianv> I think that chess is very relevant, it's a numeric, strategic, "intelligent", and very prime game of individual competition, each board and move is a new puzzle. But ima take this to Riddler now
[2013-01-07 04:24:51] <leakhmskill> hackers does not like the idea of chess
[2013-01-07 04:24:53] <leakhmskill> lol
[2013-01-07 04:24:54] <n00b_> We may have to wait until all of the parts are posted to Twitter, and collect them in a .txt file, then convert it to a jpeg
[2013-01-07 04:25:16] <leakhmskill> well, who knows when the twitter is going to stop?
[2013-01-07 04:25:39] <Dafodilianv> I'm a riddler, I gather data and analyse it, I have no neat tricks or machines to do things for me, I'm just trying to form systems of logic out of chaos

[2013-01-07 04:26:13] <leakhmskill> I still think we need to be sorting the twitter posts

[2013-01-07 04:47:59] <pr0> now that you mention it i wonder why it will be around you and not around us
[2013-01-07 04:48:04] <Flumentia> No idea what the key leads to. And what came from the JPG clue?
[2013-01-07 04:48:17] <leakhmskill> so far, very little from jpg
[2013-01-07 04:48:19] <Flumentia> The wiki doesn't go that far yet, interested
[2013-01-07 04:48:29] <leakhmskill> as for anagram
[2013-01-07 04:48:31] <scrounger> presumably to the twitter. they say "@1...1\n\nthe key is all around you", we go to @1...1 and we get the crazy fucked up jpg

[2013-01-07 04:48:56] <c4_> Maybe around you instead of us because it is something you definitely have, but not everyone does. The only thing they cna gurantee really is internet
[2013-01-07 04:49:10] <Bloodbane> Same pattern as the previous two cases ive seen
[2013-01-07 04:49:18] <Bloodbane>  yet ive not cared much for
[2013-01-07 04:49:28] <scrounger> of course, the CD is round. and it's all around.

[2013-01-07 04:51:38] <bak|afk> this, right?
[2013-01-07 04:51:50] <scrounger> pr0, this is second year they've done this. same PGP sigs. it's legit.
[2013-01-07 04:52:09] <scrounger> i worked on it last year for a while but fell behind because school.
[2013-01-07 04:52:09] <Bloodbane> In fact this has all been repeated over the past in numerous occasions, I even have an old archive of someone whom cracked a case... then dissapeared.
[2013-01-07 04:52:26] <scrounger> Bloodbane, post it, please?
[2013-01-07 04:52:44] <Cosmo_> I'm taking that old mp3 into a university sound lab tomorrow. I'm not convinced everything that can be had from that is available yet.
[2013-01-07 04:52:44] <Bloodbane> Let me dig it up, I have to encrypt these things ya know.
[2013-01-07 04:53:10] <leakhmskill> I think we could get more from the audio
[2013-01-07 04:53:37] <Flumentia> OK, I get the feeling that if we can work out these twitter messages, then they'll all combine to create some kind of file. We just need all of the dumps completed.
[2013-01-07 04:53:43] <Cosmo_> Luckily I'm in a uniquely well placed position to have another look at that mp3.
[2013-01-07 04:53:44] <n00b_> @cosmo Do you think that maybe there could be an algorythm hidden in the music?
[2013-01-07 04:54:44] <Bloodbane> Sadly by sources unmentionable i am not allowed to upload or distribute the archives. They contain sensitive information that the group i beling into has highly valued and classified as confidential.
[2013-01-07 04:54:48] <Cosmo_> I was actually going to approach it from the more obvious end. The 'reverse' effects are what's intrigueing me. Usually those random note patterns reversed fit to enhance a sound, but in terms of this mp3 they slide off key in seemingly random places
[2013-01-07 04:54:51] <Flumentia> What scares me most about this is that 3301 is/are watching us right now as we solve it.

[2013-01-07 05:05:03] <Flumentia> That thread can't be it. It's too easy to obscure the message by posting fake stuff.
[2013-01-07 05:05:20] <primius> there should always be a /b/ thread
[2013-01-07 05:05:31] <primius> or we'll never find the right people to solve this
[2013-01-07 05:05:48] <Dafodilianv> We should still cull them.
[2013-01-07 05:05:50] <primius> also, did anyone post to reddit yet?
[2013-01-07 05:05:51] <Flumentia> Cicada would be smarter. We have to look at the stuff which we KNOW is from them. The Twitter account we can take a pretty safe guess at, but the 4chan thread could be a fake for all we know.
[2013-01-07 05:06:17] <Flumentia> Don't think so. Most of /b/ are against reddit.

[2013-01-07 05:07:20] <Cosmo_> It's ok, i began saving the lines posted. For the sake of ordering i've grouped them. One group is the strings that are replying to the string before
[2013-01-07 05:07:26] <Dafodilianv> Posting ID followed by a string of data
[2013-01-07 05:07:38] <Cosmo_> the other group is of strings posted in reply to OP or under 'heaven;
[2013-01-07 05:08:04] <bakpak2hvy> i got something from the first image
[2013-01-07 05:08:05] <leakhmskill> the ID heaven is someone who is saging the thread

[2013-01-07 05:08:27] <Flumentia> Cosmo_: The second group is probably the fake ones. If the string has a reply to it, and the line is unbroken until OP, then it's probably real.

[2013-01-07 05:25:02] <c4_> In this http://pastebin.com/dHJ6JNkr it's written that "They [cicada] believe that within each person there is a "God." Not "God" in the sense of most religions, it is more like Übermensch in the writings of Nietzsche. They also see the Global Brain as another kind of "God"" Could this be a further meaning of "Find the divinity within"?

[2013-01-07 06:00:07] <c4_> wikipedia says In monotheistic faiths, the word divinity is often used to refer to the singular God central to that faith. Often the word takes the definite article and is capitalized — "the Divinity" — as though it were a proper name or definitive honorific

[2013-01-07 06:25:36] <leakhmskill> hey
[2013-01-07 06:25:46] <leakhmskill> does anyone know what the tweet headers are?
[2013-01-07 06:25:55] <leakhmskill> i mean, are they counting up
[2013-01-07 06:26:10] <soulseekah> they're offsets
[2013-01-07 06:26:14] <soulseekah> 65 bytes
[2013-01-07 06:26:19] <leakhmskill> and if so, at what point will it run out of space in the 7 digits?
[2013-01-07 06:26:28] <Dafodilianv> I proposed that they are a timing system used in chess
[2013-01-07 06:26:30] <leakhmskill> how many tweets?

[2013-01-07 06:28:00] <Dafodilianv> It was constant at 5 the entire time I documented it on the wiki
[2013-01-07 06:28:17] <anonalaala> it changed to 4 at some point
[2013-01-07 06:28:19] <leakhmskill> well, maybe it will stop tweeting at some point

[2013-01-07 06:29:10] <leakhmskill> was there a change in headers?
[2013-01-07 06:29:11] <soulseekah> i doubt it will be tweeting 260 mb of data
[2013-01-07 06:29:31] <leakhmskill> with the change in intervals?
[2013-01-07 06:29:57] <anonalaala> it makes no sense that they would just make us wait.  THere's a reason it's like this... if it's an image, why make us wait to compile it.  Why not just give us the code to see what we can do with it
[2013-01-07 06:30:01] <soulseekah> nope
[2013-01-07 06:30:32] <leakhmskill> let's say we didn't have the twitter, what could we do instead?

[2013-01-07 06:32:16] <Dafodilianv> or 11/10/11
[2013-01-07 06:32:35] <anonalaala> honestly there's got to be a way to identify the song.  I haven't shazam'd it but /mu/ didn't turn up anything, all my hipster buddies don't know it
[2013-01-07 06:32:56] <Anonymous_user1> i can shazam it now.
[2013-01-07 06:33:00] <Dafodilianv> It's probably original
[2013-01-07 06:33:04] <Dafodilianv> but youc an try
[2013-01-07 06:33:14] <Skel_> did anyone even bother to search the other videos on the channels?

[2013-01-07 06:33:16] <anonalaala> I could be wrong, but I don't think someone at Cicada just decided to write and perform a song
[2013-01-07 06:33:34] <Dafodilianv> the youtube channel isn't official
[2013-01-07 06:33:43] <Cosmo_> I'm mostly confused about the quality. These guys can do all this but they choose a shitty recording?
[2013-01-07 06:33:44] <Dafodilianv> neither are the pictures
[2013-01-07 06:33:59] <Dafodilianv> that's also youtube shitting it up

[2013-01-07 06:34:04] <Dafodilianv> they didn't upload it to youtube
[2013-01-07 06:34:07] <Anonymous_user1> Its not original
[2013-01-07 06:34:09] <Dafodilianv> and recursive

[2013-01-07 06:39:08] <Cosmo_> That's ok. I'm going to do it and find out. Although it's with pretty low tech software. I'll combine the normals and reversed clips, see how it goes.

[2013-01-07 06:40:03] <alkapwn> I reversed it in audacity and played it over the original track and I'm definitely hearing something...nothing significant but theres sound there
[2013-01-07 06:40:15] <JackHinds> did you normalize it?
[2013-01-07 06:40:59] <alkapwn> trying that now
[2013-01-07 06:41:11] <alexanderthegrea> maxxtro9: well it's good to know the significance of the twitter handle
[2013-01-07 06:41:16] <Cosmo_> Why normalise it? If there's something there you'll lose it
[2013-01-07 06:41:28] <JackHinds> lol
[2013-01-07 06:41:30] <JackHinds> how's that?
[2013-01-07 06:41:58] <Cosmo_> Normalising in audacity is setting a limit and reducing the peaks and bringing the dips to the same level
[2013-01-07 06:42:13] <Cosmo_> It makes the quiet bits loud and the loud bits quiet
[2013-01-07 06:42:33] <Lurker69>  i dont know much about audio engineering but  people skilled in it said that song is palindrmoic, when i asked if that means that reverse  is the same they told that not exactly but that if you play them both they cancel each other...
[2013-01-07 06:42:34] <JackHinds> then i guess audacity is shitty
[2013-01-07 06:42:37] <JackHinds> try soundforge
[2013-01-07 06:42:42] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, that's compression
[2013-01-07 06:42:46] <JackHinds> you can't lose sound
[2013-01-07 06:42:56] <Cosmo_> No compression is setting a peak.
[2013-01-07 06:42:59] <JackHinds> because the original mp3 is kinda silent

[2013-01-07 06:43:35] <JackHinds> well
[2013-01-07 06:43:40] <JackHinds> audacity is a shitty program my friend
[2013-01-07 06:43:40] <soulseekah> compression is what you described as "the quiet bits loud and the loud bits quiet"
[2013-01-07 06:43:49] <Cosmo_> hang on
[2013-01-07 06:43:56] <JackHinds> why don't you download soundforge?

[2013-01-07 06:44:15] <primius> compression makes waves squarer, that is all
[2013-01-07 06:44:21] <soulseekah> no

[2013-01-07 06:45:49] <alexanderthegrea> a steeper wave just means a larger jump from one level to the next

[2013-01-07 06:46:22] <Cosmo_> A square wave spends longer at a higher amplitude because without it's gradient, it's got a higher 'on' time
[2013-01-07 06:46:29] <Cosmo_> it's not louder, there's just more of it

[2013-01-07 06:46:41] <soulseekah> in any case start with a freqency graph

[2013-01-07 06:47:45] <JackHinds> i got an idea
[2013-01-07 06:47:46] <Cosmo_> It's not palindromic, and I've just noticed that both stereo tracks have slight variations
[2013-01-07 06:47:55] <Cosmo_> That's unusual for an mp3 as it is.
[2013-01-07 06:48:10] <JackHinds> did you play them both at the same time, one normal and one reverse?
[2013-01-07 06:48:26] <soulseekah> has anyone got an image of the spetrogram of the song?
[2013-01-07 06:48:34] <Cosmo_> Yep, I'm hearing nothing so unusual it jumps out at me, but I'm going to get another looks later
[2013-01-07 06:48:55] <Cosmo_> Not right now. In a couple of hours I'll be doing it on Logic and pro tools. Anyone else?
[2013-01-07 06:49:06] <JackHinds> ok
[2013-01-07 06:49:08] <JackHinds> try this

[2013-01-07 06:49:18] <JackHinds> i doubled the speed

[2013-01-07 06:49:47] <JackHinds> it sounds better in a way that resembles the original music better
[2013-01-07 06:49:50] <JackHinds> they slowed it down
[2013-01-07 06:50:01] <JackHinds> i think they want us to identify the origin of the song

[2013-01-07 07:09:04] <Cosmo_> I find those bpms to be very intentional. It's clear the guitarist is playing to a click track or metronome.
[2013-01-07 07:09:13] <JackHinds> also
[2013-01-07 07:09:16] <JackHinds> there's constant reversing
[2013-01-07 07:09:26] <JackHinds> constant switching between normal and reverse
[2013-01-07 07:09:52] <Cosmo_> Yeah I just looked into the reversing. All I've noticed is there are two instruments being reversed. One is the guitar itself, sliding up and down one string
[2013-01-07 07:09:59] <Cosmo_> the other sounds like a dodouk

[2013-01-07 07:12:20] <JackHinds> i speeded up the last part
[2013-01-07 07:12:24] <JackHinds> and it sounds like it should
[2013-01-07 07:12:26] <indigo_> the name of the mp3 is the second count reversed, thats even more reversing
[2013-01-07 07:12:32] <indigo_> try reversing the zip name
[2013-01-07 07:13:23] <maxxtro9> is it just me or at 00:42 it seems to skip a bit of the song? Sounds like a mistake while playing
[2013-01-07 07:13:57] <Cosmo_> I don't understand, if all these poems are about growth and stuff, why are they so obsessed with going backwards? Since when are regression and evolution the same thing?

[2013-01-07 07:25:25] <JackHinds> did you listen to it?
[2013-01-07 07:25:25] <soulseekah> and the start does seem to be a header overall
[2013-01-07 07:25:36] <Fasd> Has anyone else noticed that the ending numbers (.00 .13 .17) match up perfectly with the emergence cycles to cicada (the 00 refers to the periodical emergence cycle)
[2013-01-07 07:25:57] <Flumentia> Shit that 000028a bit is pretty much throughout that string or a cut version of it.

[2013-01-07 07:26:46] <soulseekah> 28a is just an offset as I see it
[2013-01-07 07:27:18] <soulseekah> but the data is rather strangely self-referrant
[2013-01-07 07:27:29] <soulseekah> it keeps on repeating around offset 28a

[2013-01-07 07:43:35] <soulseekah> I did do a couple of edits
[2013-01-07 07:43:39] <Flumentia> Just opened that .raw in photoshop, I can confirm it's most probably some sort of file. All of the 0028a's create a very weird top part to it...
[2013-01-07 07:43:41] <soulseekah> in the wiki about the twitter
[2013-01-07 07:43:50] <soulseekah> but it's not a JPG, nothing to indicate it to be a jpg so far
[2013-01-07 07:43:56] <Asa> 1,595,277,641 what about reversing these, use roman numbers then caesar cipher them?

[2013-01-07 07:44:41] <soulseekah> so?
[2013-01-07 07:44:50] <Flumentia> It seems odd
[2013-01-07 07:44:56] <soulseekah> maxxtro9, not an indication of a JPG
[2013-01-07 07:45:03] <maxxtro9> just odd
[2013-01-07 07:45:08] <Flumentia> But if it were deliberate it would either be a palindrome or a prime number
[2013-01-07 07:45:11] <soulseekah> although bears some resemblance to meta headers for JFIF
[2013-01-07 07:45:34] <Lurker69> soulseekah: so no jpg in your opinion?
[2013-01-07 07:45:40] <soulseekah> for now no
[2013-01-07 07:46:13] <Lesmo> I think tweet chunks have to be ordered
[2013-01-07 07:46:14] <Lurker69> but but resemblance to meta headers for JFIF
[2013-01-07 07:46:35] <soulseekah> resemblance, many formats have such padding in meta data areas
[2013-01-07 07:46:36] <Lesmo> Maybe other format?
[2013-01-07 07:46:51] <soulseekah> look trhough http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures for patterns
[2013-01-07 07:46:56] <soulseekah> so far I've found none
[2013-01-07 07:47:06] <soulseekah> but the data may be encrypted
[2013-01-07 07:47:59] <soulseekah> trying to offset the byte values by +01..02 etc.
[2013-01-07 07:48:10] <soulseekah> simple shift cipher
[2013-01-07 07:48:26] <soulseekah> but once the tweets stop we can assume to have complete data we can try PGP
[2013-01-07 07:48:36] <soulseekah> which is highly probably
[2013-01-07 07:48:47] <alexanderthegrea> assuming the tweets do stop

[2013-01-07 07:49:50] <maxxtro9> the last letters, it seems odd to me at least
[2013-01-07 07:50:05] <soulseekah> it's some sort of metadata padding it seems
[2013-01-07 07:50:24] <soulseekah> such ordered data is common in meta areas of some formats, like JPG
[2013-01-07 07:50:34] <Lurker69> that looks the same as for jpgs, but  it is hjust padding
[2013-01-07 07:50:43] <soulseekah> Lurker69, interesting thoughts
[2013-01-07 07:50:52] <soulseekah> let's see now
[2013-01-07 07:51:04] <soulseekah> say we disregard the headers
[2013-01-07 07:51:15] <soulseekah> and take a chunk at say offset 0x1000

[2013-01-07 07:51:51] <soulseekah> Flumentia, the 7 digit headers are OFFSETS

[2013-01-07 07:52:33] <soulseekah> http://codeseekah.com/cicada/tweets.html contains the "headers" unaltered but are really byte offsets
[2013-01-07 07:52:47] <soulseekah> which points to the theory that the data is ordered
[2013-01-07 07:53:00] <soulseekah> and is coming in top to bottom
[2013-01-07 07:53:13] <Flumentia> OK.

[2013-01-07 07:59:30] <alexanderthegrea> as easy as it would be to say we just have to wait until it finishes and then just translate it from there i think it would 1, rely on it being exactly the size of 0000000-fffffff, and 2, be a lot simpler albeit time consuming than i would expect

[2013-01-07 07:59:32] <brotherBox> Well...it would be a very improbable pattern between ciphertext and plain text. 00-FF is in the hex range and its output could come from anything, if we take more advance statistics out of account.
[2013-01-07 07:59:33] <soulseekah> so at least the header does not seem to be encrypted by

[2013-01-07 08:01:32] <alexanderthegrea> it was the most recent header on the twitter when he posted that

[2013-01-07 08:02:07] <soulseekah> alexanderthegrea, those headers are offsets

[2013-01-07 08:07:28] <soulseekah> those are not natural

[2013-01-07 08:12:03] <soulseekah> as I see it there are several strategies we can employ in regards to twitter: a. find the magic number before offset 0x1000 (4096 bytes in), b. try a shift cipher to find a magic number at offset 1
[2013-01-07 08:12:14] <soulseekah> I mean offset 0, sorry
[2013-01-07 08:13:00] <soulseekah> now in regards to the header itself as is we have 2 things: first is the sequence CDEF.... with missing bytes at regular intervals it seems (KLMNOPQR)
[2013-01-07 08:13:13] <Lurker69> what is that "magic number"
[2013-01-07 08:13:26] <maxxtro9> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
[2013-01-07 08:13:28] <soulseekah> a MAGIC number is an identifier for a filetype
[2013-01-07 08:13:39] <soulseekah> for example all EXEs in windows start with magic bytes MZ
[2013-01-07 08:13:41] <soulseekah> etc.
[2013-01-07 08:13:59] <soulseekah> once we identify the filetype of the data being dumped we can open it with the appropriate reader
[2013-01-07 08:14:10] <Cosmo_> Getting nothing in terms of audio with the Raw data, but without knowing a sample rate to head for it's always just going to come out as bleeps and bloops at best, white noise at worst
[2013-01-07 08:14:13] <soulseekah> be it an image reader, an audio reader or an archive reder
[2013-01-07 08:14:27] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, yes
[2013-01-07 08:14:32] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Category:IRC_LOGS
[2013-01-07 08:15:02] <soulseekah> we have 0101 repetitions, 00a28 repetitions
[2013-01-07 08:15:18] <soulseekah> now if we take 00a28 as an actual byte offset and go find it
[2013-01-07 08:15:31] <Lurker69> soulseekah: so lets make list of all the identifier numbers and check for the match...  ar are there too many
[2013-01-07 08:15:36] <soulseekah> it's already past the header
[2013-01-07 08:15:50] <soulseekah> addreses a00 is quite into what I call the "data" part
[2013-01-07 08:16:13] <soulseekah> the "header" part seems to end around offset 0x3co
[2013-01-07 08:16:23] <soulseekah> after all the 0x28 bytes end

[2013-01-07 08:32:52] <soulseekah> ok so .13 looks like a legit format
[2013-01-07 08:32:54] <Lesmo> Yeah, Notepad++ is better at that stuff.
[2013-01-07 08:33:02] <Lesmo> What you mean legit?
[2013-01-07 08:33:05] <soulseekah> with a header and data
[2013-01-07 08:33:21] <soulseekah> lookup 968e bdaf 5267 7a0d 0e21 6f40 4041 414f 5354 as magic numbers
[2013-01-07 08:33:29] <maxxtro9> fuck i have to leave, how am i supposed to know what happens frrom now on?

[2013-01-07 08:34:01] <Lesmo> ... or come around and lurk :P
[2013-01-07 08:34:31] <soulseekah> .17 is just data
[2013-01-07 08:34:44] <Lesmo> lol what you mean with "just data"?
[2013-01-07 08:34:50] <maxxtro9> hopefully tomorrow this will still be going on and im not left behind lol
[2013-01-07 08:34:54] <soulseekah> means no evident "header"
[2013-01-07 08:34:59] <soulseekah> unlike .13
[2013-01-07 08:35:00] <Lesmo> Oh, ok.
[2013-01-07 08:35:13] <Lesmo> Have you seen the file sizes?
[2013-01-07 08:35:21] <Lesmo> Two of those files are numeric palindromes.
[2013-01-07 08:35:25] <soulseekah> so what we have is .13 has an evident header of sorts, then the others only data
[2013-01-07 08:35:34] <soulseekah> many formats can be padded
[2013-01-07 08:35:55] <soulseekah> but padding can eliminte a handful of signed formats
[2013-01-07 08:36:40] <youdontknow> tried it as an iso, doesn't appear to be working, .13 that is
[2013-01-07 08:37:37] <Cosmo_> Random info injection. Using your guys most recent raw data from twitter and converting it using GSM 6.10 into audacity creates an apparent random sounding soundscape that fits vocal frequency range. Gonna see if that leads anywhere.
[2013-01-07 08:37:52] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, interesting good luck
[2013-01-07 08:38:39] <soulseekah> what do we know about the given disk image?
[2013-01-07 08:38:52] <youdontknow> as in the 3301 iso?

[2013-01-07 08:49:16] <soulseekah> I'll be working on the iso until the twitter data dump is complete though
[2013-01-07 08:49:37] <Flumentia> Still working through, haven't found anything useful other than that. I'd say it COULD be backwards and that could be a trailer.
[2013-01-07 08:50:09] <soulseekah> could be a footer, but I know of no formats with a footer in them
[2013-01-07 08:50:22] <soulseekah> except signed data perhaps
[2013-01-07 08:50:41] <soulseekah> but it doesn't look anywhere near what we currently have

[2013-01-07 10:35:38] <soulseekah> let me try with the latest tweets now
[2013-01-07 10:35:42] <brotherBox> Perl or Python?
[2013-01-07 10:35:47] <scrounger> so, did you guys read Book of the Law Chapter 2 Line 55?
[2013-01-07 10:35:47] <Lurker69> Elder Futhark is the most ancient Germanic runic alphabet that was in use from the 2nd to 8th centuries by all Germanic tribes. This system of runic writing has a very peculiar and complex inner structure.
[2013-01-07 10:36:03] <brotherBox> Imma do Perl because I can do that better
[2013-01-07 10:36:09] <scrounger> That's not what it says though, Lurker69
[2013-01-07 10:36:13] <Ymgve> scrounger: no, we are kinda busy xoring everything with everything
[2013-01-07 10:36:31] <scrounger> it's in a differnt order than what you're saying, Lurker69
[2013-01-07 10:36:31] <lolxD> uhh... so the tweet are slowly became runic table?
[2013-01-07 10:36:53] <scrounger> Ymgve: gotcha. But you should read it because it relates.  In fact the image seems to be quoting it.
[2013-01-07 10:36:59] <scrounger> I googled it.
[2013-01-07 10:37:07] <AlooGobi> Where do you guys learn all this stuff. Way over my head

[2013-01-07 10:40:49] <Lurker69> Short Twig variant of the Younger Futhark is also known as Rök runes. It was used in Norway and Sweden along with the Long Branch variant that was more characteristic for Denmark.

[2013-01-07 10:49:05] <Lurker69> anyway runes in the table are  of two different sorts  left column are germanic tight column are denmark      http://prntscr.com/oecyv       http://prntscr.com/oectu
[2013-01-07 10:49:12] <lolxD> pray?

[2013-01-07 10:49:27] <Lurker69> i will ad new png to wiki
[2013-01-07 10:49:54] <AlooGobi> Alright, from what I understand is that this XOR mp3 is a decoder which converts data into a png file? And the file you guys are working on is linked above which is about 1/3 complete?
[2013-01-07 10:49:59] <soulseekah> let me see if I can get a larger image

[2013-01-07 10:50:29] <Cosmo_> Holy. Shit

[2013-01-07 11:01:02] <Lurker69> 	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1593421/3301/testout.jpg  is mp3 xor twitter right?
[2013-01-07 11:01:21] <Ymgve> yeah
[2013-01-07 11:01:47] <Lurker69> so how could you get whole image if we dont have all the tweets yet?
[2013-01-07 11:02:01] <Ymgve> but the full formula is mp3 xor twitter xor 560.13 = base64
[2013-01-07 11:02:02] <Cosmo_> There's another image?
[2013-01-07 11:02:09] <Ymgve> AND
[2013-01-07 11:02:18] <Ymgve> the base64 is actually two parts
[2013-01-07 11:02:28] <Ymgve> first a base64 image, then the text 33010 repeated
[2013-01-07 11:03:15] <AlooGobi> If you look downwards from the top of your screen
[2013-01-07 11:03:15] <Ymgve> I just assumed that it would continue to have 33010 repeated, thus recreating all the data in base64
[2013-01-07 11:03:15] <AlooGobi> there are blemishes in the picture.
[2013-01-07 11:03:23] <Ymgve> and then I took base64 xor 560.13 xor mp3 = twitter
[2013-01-07 11:03:31] <AlooGobi> small outliers?
[2013-01-07 11:04:05] <chimp> < <@Ymgve> and then I took base64 xor 560.13 xor mp3 = twitter  <-- huh?

[2013-01-07 11:05:52] <AlooGobi> THIS IS INSANELY FUN
[2013-01-07 11:06:09] <chimp> we have a decoding table

[2013-01-07 11:06:15] <chimp> right?
[2013-01-07 11:06:16] <soulseekah> what could 7d35 d37d f4d7 4df mean?
[2013-01-07 11:06:21] <Ymgve> might go to work soon, so this is the next step: the decoding image has a GPG message embedded
[2013-01-07 11:06:24] <Cosmo_> That's how it looks.
[2013-01-07 11:06:34] <Ymgve> the message _appears_ blank, but it actually has a pattern of spaces and tabs

[2013-01-07 11:28:32] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, we used the song to xor the twitter data to get a png
[2013-01-07 11:28:41] <Cosmo_> The mp3 itself was important
[2013-01-07 11:28:44] <p0lyvalent> Maybe not music, but sound.
[2013-01-07 11:28:57] <Cosmo_> the music......meh, maybe later, but as of yet I've found nothing in there

[2013-01-07 11:29:09] <soulseekah> probably nothing in the music itself

[2013-01-07 11:29:35] <andorraclaim> the riff starts on the third fret
[2013-01-07 11:29:36] <Cosmo_> Oh I isolated the 'breath' sound at the start too, i'm actually pretty sure it's the sound of a group of cicadas

[2013-01-07 11:37:16] <soulseekah> brotherBox, what about the other headers?
[2013-01-07 11:37:16] <andorraclaim> thats not a bass drum

[2013-01-07 11:37:26] <brotherBox> soulseekah, nothing!
[2013-01-07 11:37:27] <Cosmo_> it has almost a drone bass note. What gets to me most about the song is this. It's a bad recording. As in it's been very badly recorded with what sounds like piss-poo equipment even for a bedroom set up. But it's very specifically edited.
[2013-01-07 11:37:28] <andorraclaim> what are they called...

[2013-01-07 12:36:13] <Cosmo_> Hahaaa, we said that
[2013-01-07 12:36:26] <Cicada> He wouldn't of given it over so easy then.
[2013-01-07 12:36:32] <Absence_> >mfw Ymgve has brutal fetish with mathematics and specially prime numbers
[2013-01-07 12:36:42] <Cicada> ^
[2013-01-07 12:37:03] <Cicada> Let him finish bating to his work before he comes back to finish.
[2013-01-07 12:37:25] <Absence_> yeah guys. so inconsiderate. ggez.
[2013-01-07 12:37:29] <soulseekah> also queued up is the black PNG image
[2013-01-07 12:37:30] <artea> im still pretty amazed that the entire poem converted to primes adds up to 3 prime reversible numbers
[2013-01-07 12:37:39] <soulseekah> any image geeks tried any filters on it?

[2013-01-07 12:38:23] <NikTitanik> the image with the runes and letters is the result of xoring the mp3 and the twitter?
[2013-01-07 12:38:25] <Cosmo_> Anyone else noticed that the conversion table has no 'v' in it?
[2013-01-07 12:38:27] <Absence_> im assuming they saw that in firefox
[2013-01-07 12:38:34] <Absence_> considering that is way hard to see in chrome
[2013-01-07 12:38:47] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, yes, but it appears that something else was XORd not twitter, twitter is tweeting out something redundant
[2013-01-07 12:39:09] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-07 12:39:10] <soulseekah> becuause people have been able to get the complete dump, whereas twitter contains around half of the info necessary
[2013-01-07 12:39:28] <Lurker69> Absence_:  i am a bit behind but  when you opened first onion page  first time did you def full asii cicada or only  top 2/3 of it?
[2013-01-07 12:39:30] <rb9269> it would be stupid to assume that the twitter feed is now worthless
[2013-01-07 12:39:36] <soulseekah> it's probably tweeting a dump from one of the data files from the iso
[2013-01-07 12:39:52] <fffgg> cosmo yes we did
[2013-01-07 12:40:02] <soulseekah> rb9269, only time will tell now

[2013-01-07 12:41:34] <Cosmo_> Cause it's crawling out of the ground ;)
[2013-01-07 12:41:34] <Lurker69> what is causing the change? there is nothing in the code...  
[2013-01-07 12:41:40] <chimp> maybe its the count donw

[2013-01-07 12:41:45] <onon> lurker what code
[2013-01-07 12:41:48] <soulseekah> or the number of poeple connected to it
[2013-01-07 12:41:53] <chimp> its counting down and completing the cicada
[2013-01-07 12:41:55] <Absence_> i guess when solved it finished it

[2013-01-07 12:58:28] <brotherBox> Ymgve and n_factor don't respond at the moment, which is great.
[2013-01-07 12:58:58] <soulseekah> the tweets are redundant, tweeting out a piece of data that we (or at least Ymgve) already hold
[2013-01-07 12:59:19] <Cicada> i guess they didn't expect that one.
[2013-01-07 12:59:23] <anonalaala> hey anyone on the telnet have you put in the sentences from the original poem about the law book?
[2013-01-07 12:59:29] <anonalaala> is that relevant at all?

[2013-01-07 13:00:07] <chimp> i suggested that at the time

[2013-01-07 13:00:27] <soulseekah> anyone wanna find those in the books mentioned above?

[2013-01-07 13:06:12] <n_factor> thats my question
[2013-01-07 13:06:13] <soulseekah> probably a file off the the Tiny Linux iso filesystem (3301.img in BOOT)
[2013-01-07 13:06:20] <soulseekah> or one of the DATA files
[2013-01-07 13:06:24] <soulseekah> not sure which one yet
[2013-01-07 13:06:25] <n_factor> how did Ymgve get the full tweet defore it finished
[2013-01-07 13:06:29] <brotherBox> ^
[2013-01-07 13:06:35] <brotherBox> He doesn't respond atm.
[2013-01-07 13:06:42] <Absence_> i believe he did something with 3301
[2013-01-07 13:06:45] <Absence_> the number
[2013-01-07 13:06:46] <n_factor> i xored all the DATA files with the song
[2013-01-07 13:06:50] <Absence_> wasnt here for that part
[2013-01-07 13:06:59] <soulseekah> n_factor, probably a file on the filesystem itself
[2013-01-07 13:07:04] <soulseekah> like the .sh file that generated primes
[2013-01-07 13:07:11] <soulseekah> or rather echoed them out with delays

[2013-01-07 13:08:18] <soulseekah> where did he get the rest 100k from

[2013-01-07 13:08:55] <n_factor> the data needed to xor with the song is not on the disk in plaintext
[2013-01-07 13:09:32] <n_factor> i xor'd all the data files and song together in every permiation

[2013-01-07 13:41:49] <Lurker69> at first it was 2/3 of cicada later it was whole cicad wuth welcome on the bottom
[2013-01-07 13:42:09] <Lurker69>  cosmo said that cicada is coming from the ground

[2013-01-07 13:42:13] <iIIustrious> it apparently goes back to 2/3rd sometimes
[2013-01-07 13:42:21] <iIIustrious> probably a weird caching thing
[2013-01-07 13:42:21] <NikTitanik> when i first entered the first onion link it only loaded half of the pgae, looking like the first image, when i refreshed it loaded it whole
[2013-01-07 13:42:26] <NikTitanik> maybe it was just a tor error
[2013-01-07 13:42:37] <Lurker69> but in reality i have no idea what trigered  change on the page, maybe it was telneting
[2013-01-07 13:42:48] <Cosmo_> In terms of the runes we're looking at a variation on this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Anglosaxonrunes.svg
[2013-01-07 13:42:51] <Grazza> where are you guys getting the onions?
[2013-01-07 13:43:10] <NikTitanik> grocery store
[2013-01-07 13:43:12] <iIIustrious> outguess the jpg on the twitter wiki page
[2013-01-07 13:43:15] <n_factor> the onions came from an outguess of an image
[2013-01-07 13:43:18] <Lurker69> grazza, basical from jpg that came from twiits
[2013-01-07 13:43:24] <Cosmo_> This is probably closer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes
[2013-01-07 13:43:25] <Grazza> kk
[2013-01-07 13:43:25] <n_factor> how did we get that image illustrious

[2013-01-07 13:48:57] <brotherBox> qwebirc47775, check the topic.
[2013-01-07 13:49:03] <iIIustrious> I haven't got my head around how to make real info out of that

[2013-01-07 13:57:51] <chimp> thanks
[2013-01-07 13:58:20] <crash_demons> do you know of any servers that run a tor proxy to allow users who don't want to run tor to access tor servers? (completely possible to set up)
[2013-01-07 13:58:49] <brotherBox> There is something like that for websites/hidden services
[2013-01-07 13:58:55] <fffgg> so now we're just stuck with Hash: SHA1
[2013-01-07 13:59:01] <brotherBox> Let me check
[2013-01-07 13:59:11] <brotherBox> crash_demons, http://onion.to/
[2013-01-07 13:59:12] <crash_demons> and by that I mean, binding to 0.0.0.0 instead of Localhost

[2013-01-07 14:00:02] <crash_demons> I would run tor, but the startup sequence is kind of bandwidth-heavy
[2013-01-07 14:00:40] <n_factor> since 761.mp3 XOR 560.13 XOR twitter = base64.cicada.png + "33013301...3301"
[2013-01-07 14:01:19] <n_factor> you can just add the 3301's to the end of base64.cicada.png to the length of the longest file of the other 3
[2013-01-07 14:01:46] <Grazza> WOW
[2013-01-07 14:01:48] <n_factor> then do base64.cicada.png XOR 560.13 XOR 761.mp3 = twitter
[2013-01-07 14:01:51] <Grazza> that makes so much more sense
[2013-01-07 14:01:51] <n_factor> to get the final jpg
[2013-01-07 14:01:51] <Grazza> lol

[2013-01-07 14:04:13] <brotherBox> Was it just that hidden service domain?

[2013-01-07 15:16:46] <n_factor> 61 is prime
[2013-01-07 15:16:55] <n_factor> so it assumes you put it in backwards
[2013-01-07 15:17:18] <n_factor> its really there to search for primes that are prime both forward and backward
[2013-01-07 15:17:21] <crash_demons> so only palindromic primes are +'s ?
[2013-01-07 15:17:39] <crash_demons> this is really convoluted.

[2013-01-07 15:24:52] <crash_demons> of?
[2013-01-07 15:25:30] <crash_demons> decimal value of * is 42.
[2013-01-07 15:25:32] <Cosmo_> What if they're literally to just highlight certan letters?
[2013-01-07 15:25:37] <indigo_> + is 1, * is 0, find the value of those and convert them to base 10, I haven't looked at the telenet, so maybe be therorizing is a bit null, but otherwise give it a try
[2013-01-07 15:25:37] <Cosmo_> *certain
[2013-01-07 15:26:06] <crash_demons> you want to append that bit to the end of the number it returns?
[2013-01-07 15:26:14] <crash_demons> hm
[2013-01-07 15:26:19] <indigo_> They used the pause before in the iso, the time changing in the tweets, wouldn't be suprised if they were doing it with the telenet

[2013-01-07 15:27:17] <crash_demons> "but countless more do".... maybe there are more commands that we don't know about
[2013-01-07 15:27:37] <chimp> crash i cant even connect with putty, just getting connection closed by remote host
[2013-01-07 15:27:41] <sr01> i assume that you cant use 'help'
[2013-01-07 15:27:59] <NikTitanik> you can
[2013-01-07 15:28:00] <crash_demons> sr01, help is valid, but at least one command isn't listed there so far
[2013-01-07 15:28:05] <NikTitanik> but it returns only 4 commands
[2013-01-07 15:28:09] <crash_demons> help also doesn't really explain anything
[2013-01-07 15:28:32] <Cosmo_> Try anything that refers back to earlier clues, any other key words
[2013-01-07 15:28:49] <crash_demons> I'm relatively new to this ARG so...
