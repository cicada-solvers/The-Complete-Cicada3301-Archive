Line 1047: [2013-01-07 04:28:03] -->| Cosmo_ (4d63108b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.77.99.16.139) has joined #33012013
	Line 1120: [2013-01-07 04:38:36] <Cosmo_> It's just a random thread.
	Line 1123: [2013-01-07 04:38:49] <Lurker69> cosmo nothing is random here
	Line 1125: [2013-01-07 04:39:16] <Cosmo_> No I mean I don't think the thread was created by someone who's been here long.
	Line 1207: [2013-01-07 04:52:44] <Cosmo_> I'm taking that old mp3 into a university sound lab tomorrow. I'm not convinced everything that can be had from that is available yet.
	Line 1211: [2013-01-07 04:53:43] <Cosmo_> Luckily I'm in a uniquely well placed position to have another look at that mp3.
	Line 1212: [2013-01-07 04:53:44] <n00b_> @cosmo Do you think that maybe there could be an algorythm hidden in the music?
	Line 1214: [2013-01-07 04:54:48] <Cosmo_> I was actually going to approach it from the more obvious end. The 'reverse' effects are what's intrigueing me. Usually those random note patterns reversed fit to enhance a sound, but in terms of this mp3 they slide off key in seemingly random places
	Line 1222: [2013-01-07 04:55:20] <Cosmo_> I'm going to remove the main melody as bes i can, take another look at the reversed sections
	Line 1239: [2013-01-07 04:58:36] <Cosmo_> They're all different posting ID's
	Line 1242: [2013-01-07 04:59:25] <Cosmo_> But we also have to allow for the fact that some of them will be some little fuckstick joining in because he's hilarious.
	Line 1245: [2013-01-07 04:59:51] <Cosmo_> It could be. Or if Cicada is a big group, GENUINELY posting from different IP's
	Line 1253: [2013-01-07 05:00:58] <Cosmo_> In terms of working out what they mean, I'm afraid I won't be much help. I'm a sound engineer, that's all I can help with.
	Line 1264: [2013-01-07 05:03:44] <Cosmo_> Well someone arrives talking about a /b/ thread, then a cicada thread starts. Someone's watching something.
	Line 1300: [2013-01-07 05:07:20] <Cosmo_> It's ok, i began saving the lines posted. For the sake of ordering i've grouped them. One group is the strings that are replying to the string before
	Line 1302: [2013-01-07 05:07:38] <Cosmo_> the other group is of strings posted in reply to OP or under 'heaven;
	Line 1307: [2013-01-07 05:08:27] <Flumentia> Cosmo_: The second group is probably the fake ones. If the string has a reply to it, and the line is unbroken until OP, then it's probably real.
	Line 1319: [2013-01-07 05:09:57] <Cosmo_> Flumentia: I assumed as much, I just saved them all for the sake of thoroughness
	Line 1441: [2013-01-07 05:21:50] <Cosmo_> I don't have the tools to take apart the song right now. I'll deconstruct it tomorrow.
	Line 1446: [2013-01-07 05:22:26] <Cosmo_> Is someone making a list of these tweets?
	Line 1461: [2013-01-07 05:24:23] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, http://www.allmytweets.net/?screen_name=1231507051321
	Line 1463: [2013-01-07 05:24:56] <Cosmo_> Good. Didn't know, sorry.
	Line 1473: [2013-01-07 05:26:04] <Cosmo_> Yup. Just looking back over it. It doesn't look like the posts were botted
	Line 1475: [2013-01-07 05:26:22] <Cosmo_> The post times are seemingly fairly random, 2-3 minute gaps
	Line 1476: [2013-01-07 05:27:03] <anonalaala> Cosmo_: wat? You're not talking about the twitter right?
	Line 1482: [2013-01-07 05:27:48] <Cosmo_> No the /b/ post
	Line 1549: [2013-01-07 05:35:45] <Cosmo_> Just went through the strings posted to /b/. I removed any that didn't follow the timing pattern or linking to the previous string. I also removed the 'heaven' posted strings
	Line 1550: [2013-01-07 05:36:07] <Cosmo_> I know they might be irrelevant, but I figured there's no loss recording them http://i.imgur.com/XOqUi.png
	Line 1552: [2013-01-07 05:36:44] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: what if I told you
	Line 1554: [2013-01-07 05:37:00] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: that it's completely unrelated and unencrypted base64
	Line 1555: [2013-01-07 05:37:09] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: and that the OP reads
	Line 1557: [2013-01-07 05:37:16] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: ITT we talk in base64 because we have nothing better to do
	Line 1560: [2013-01-07 05:37:47] <Cosmo_> Then I'd feel stupid, look at the clock and remember it's 5 am and I hate having food poisoning?
	Line 1572: [2013-01-07 05:38:42] <Cosmo_> However I may be able to redeem myself.
	Line 1657: [2013-01-07 05:51:38] <Cosmo_> I'm still utterly convinced this mp3 is hiding more, I just can't get to the equipment I need to analyse it for another few hours.
	Line 1660: [2013-01-07 05:51:51] <anonalaala> Cosmo: we look forward to that
	Line 1679: [2013-01-07 05:53:29] <Cosmo_> Yeah I mean more than the poem
	Line 1917: [2013-01-07 06:23:21] <Cosmo_> check the wiki
	Line 1926: [2013-01-07 06:24:23] <Cosmo_> Now I'm assuming someone's done it, but anyone backmasked the mp3? Anything?
	Line 1970: [2013-01-07 06:31:05] <Cosmo_> I've started on the music.
	Line 1990: [2013-01-07 06:33:43] <Cosmo_> I'm mostly confused about the quality. These guys can do all this but they choose a shitty recording?
	Line 2016: [2013-01-07 06:35:48] <Cosmo_> uuuh
	Line 2017: [2013-01-07 06:35:50] <Cosmo_> what?
	Line 2018: [2013-01-07 06:35:50] <Cosmo_> https://soundcloud.com/lforecordings/jewel-case-prisma-ep
	Line 2019: [2013-01-07 06:36:03] <Cosmo_> Sorry to shoot you down, but i don't think so
	Line 2026: [2013-01-07 06:37:02] <Cosmo_> I have no idea how it's palindromic at all
	Line 2030: [2013-01-07 06:37:33] <Cosmo_> Except it's not is it?
	Line 2035: [2013-01-07 06:37:50] <Cosmo_> ....I'm going to do that
	Line 2037: [2013-01-07 06:38:09] <Lurker69> Cosmo_: that is what people said, i didnt test it yet
	Line 2042: [2013-01-07 06:39:08] <Cosmo_> That's ok. I'm going to do it and find out. Although it's with pretty low tech software. I'll combine the normals and reversed clips, see how it goes.
	Line 2048: [2013-01-07 06:41:16] <Cosmo_> Why normalise it? If there's something there you'll lose it
	Line 2051: [2013-01-07 06:41:58] <Cosmo_> Normalising in audacity is setting a limit and reducing the peaks and bringing the dips to the same level
	Line 2052: [2013-01-07 06:42:13] <Cosmo_> It makes the quiet bits loud and the loud bits quiet
	Line 2056: [2013-01-07 06:42:42] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, that's compression
	Line 2058: [2013-01-07 06:42:56] <Cosmo_> No compression is setting a peak.
	Line 2063: [2013-01-07 06:43:25] <Cosmo_> While I don't like to talk about myself all that much, I'm at university studying music technology.
	Line 2067: [2013-01-07 06:43:49] <Cosmo_> hang on
	Line 2069: [2013-01-07 06:43:58] <Lurker69> Cosmo_: then you should know much more about it than me
	Line 2073: [2013-01-07 06:44:39] <Cosmo_> No, higher waves equals louder sound
	Line 2076: [2013-01-07 06:45:14] <Cosmo_> steeper just suggests a higher frequency
	Line 2080: [2013-01-07 06:45:34] <Cosmo_> Ok. I would. But that's fairly impossible.
	Line 2082: [2013-01-07 06:45:40] <Cosmo_> An amplitude is an amplitude
	Line 2086: [2013-01-07 06:46:22] <Cosmo_> A square wave spends longer at a higher amplitude because without it's gradient, it's got a higher 'on' time
	Line 2087: [2013-01-07 06:46:29] <Cosmo_> it's not louder, there's just more of it
	Line 2090: [2013-01-07 06:46:50] <Lurker69> Cosmo_: i checked i am sorry maybe  it is not palindromic ....
	Line 2092: [2013-01-07 06:47:27] <Cosmo_> No need to be sorry, we're all just looking for answers.
	Line 2096: [2013-01-07 06:47:46] <Cosmo_> It's not palindromic, and I've just noticed that both stereo tracks have slight variations
	Line 2097: [2013-01-07 06:47:55] <Cosmo_> That's unusual for an mp3 as it is.
	Line 2100: [2013-01-07 06:48:34] <Cosmo_> Yep, I'm hearing nothing so unusual it jumps out at me, but I'm going to get another looks later
	Line 2101: [2013-01-07 06:48:55] <Cosmo_> Not right now. In a couple of hours I'll be doing it on Logic and pro tools. Anyone else?
	Line 2114: [2013-01-07 06:50:03] <Cosmo_> (as a side note I'm looking at a log f spectogram on audacity)
	Line 2119: [2013-01-07 06:50:49] <Cosmo_> I'm getting everything (if anything) i can from the mp3
	Line 2122: [2013-01-07 06:51:12] <Cosmo_> JackHinds: I'll take a look
	Line 2126: [2013-01-07 06:51:54] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: square wave with peaks at 0.3 is louder than a sine wave with peaks at 0.8
	Line 2139: [2013-01-07 06:53:26] <Cosmo_> Lulzorz: I'm not saying you're wrong (You may very well be right) But can I ask where you got this from?
	Line 2145: [2013-01-07 06:53:58] <Cosmo_> Holy shit..... wait
	Line 2147: [2013-01-07 06:54:10] <leakhmskill> unless cosmo has a breakthrough
	Line 2152: [2013-01-07 06:54:36] <Cosmo_> Dammit, no I don't, sorry for the false hope
	Line 2155: [2013-01-07 06:54:59] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: I just generated them myself and listened
	Line 2166: [2013-01-07 06:56:10] <Cosmo_> Lulzorz: That's psychoacoustics for you. You're right, it sounds louder, all I'm saying is that what we hear and what is fact are two very different things. Something I learned far too much in my second year.
	Line 2177: [2013-01-07 06:57:21] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: right, which is how compression works
	Line 2180: [2013-01-07 06:57:57] <Cosmo_> lulzorz: Okay.
	Line 2185: [2013-01-07 06:58:43] <Cosmo_> soulseekah: This is good stuff.
	Line 2225: [2013-01-07 07:06:38] <Cosmo_> It may be nothing but the tracks bpm swings from an initial 135 to 145 to 125 for the final section. For anyone that's looking at the music
	Line 2226: [2013-01-07 07:07:11] <Lurker69> Cosmo_: http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?3a4686838924aa71#Gq7BMdgz8Q8Vwf9JLVbQGfht3wCMm8gFqmd+uu51uyQ=
	Line 2229: [2013-01-07 07:07:38] <indigo_> Cosmo_ : Maybe they altered the original track, thats why shazams don't work (or not in the database) someone was saying that speeding up the final section seemd interesting to him
	Line 2232: [2013-01-07 07:09:04] <Cosmo_> I find those bpms to be very intentional. It's clear the guitarist is playing to a click track or metronome.
	Line 2236: [2013-01-07 07:09:52] <Cosmo_> Yeah I just looked into the reversing. All I've noticed is there are two instruments being reversed. One is the guitar itself, sliding up and down one string
	Line 2237: [2013-01-07 07:09:59] <Cosmo_> the other sounds like a dodouk
	Line 2245: [2013-01-07 07:12:01] <Cosmo_> I've gone through the track reversed (no hidden spoken messages, sorry) but I'm sectioning it now
	Line 2252: [2013-01-07 07:13:57] <Cosmo_> I don't understand, if all these poems are about growth and stuff, why are they so obsessed with going backwards? Since when are regression and evolution the same thing?
	Line 2256: [2013-01-07 07:15:45] <Cosmo_> maxxtro9: I can't hear it. Do you mean it skips notes?
	Line 2265: [2013-01-07 07:17:52] <Cosmo_> maxxtro9: I really can't hear it, sorry. Maybe someone else can?
	Line 2268: [2013-01-07 07:18:33] <Cosmo_> JackHinds: I can't download that
	Line 2275: [2013-01-07 07:19:50] <JackHinds> cosmo
	Line 2302: [2013-01-07 07:22:29] <Cosmo_> I still can't hear that cut. Although anyone using audacity to check the music, split the stereo file. The two tracks don't quite match up
	Line 2314: [2013-01-07 07:25:22] <JackHinds> cosmo
	Line 2344: [2013-01-07 07:33:43] <Cosmo_> The sound at the start of the track the 'breath'..... Anyone else think it sounds like cicadas? A whole group of them?
	Line 2526: [2013-01-07 08:03:23] <Cosmo_> I'll start importing the raw data see if I can't pull some sounds out of it.
	Line 2529: [2013-01-07 08:03:52] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, http://codeseekah.com/cicada/out.raw raw data here (not latest, around 20 minutes old)
	Line 2530: [2013-01-07 08:04:26] <Cosmo_> Thanks
	Line 2553: [2013-01-07 08:08:28] <Cosmo_> Just imported the raw data as many different ways I could. Through GSM it sounds like wall-e fucking a speak and spell.
	Line 2556: [2013-01-07 08:08:51] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, GSM is an 8-bit encoding right?
	Line 2566: [2013-01-07 08:09:31] <Cosmo_> Honestly in terms of audacity I have no idea.
	Line 2574: [2013-01-07 08:11:13] <Lurker69> this is pretty much all until Cosmo_ came in channel
	Line 2587: [2013-01-07 08:14:10] <Cosmo_> Getting nothing in terms of audio with the Raw data, but without knowing a sample rate to head for it's always just going to come out as bleeps and bloops at best, white noise at worst
	Line 2589: [2013-01-07 08:14:27] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, yes
	Line 2694: [2013-01-07 08:37:37] <Cosmo_> Random info injection. Using your guys most recent raw data from twitter and converting it using GSM 6.10 into audacity creates an apparent random sounding soundscape that fits vocal frequency range. Gonna see if that leads anywhere.
	Line 2695: [2013-01-07 08:37:52] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, interesting good luck
	Line 2698: [2013-01-07 08:39:07] <Lesmo> Interesting Cosmo_
	Line 2746: [2013-01-07 08:59:42] <Cosmo_> You know you've been awake too long when you laugh at "Everybody loves Raymond"
	Line 2749: [2013-01-07 09:00:41] <Cosmo_> Good point. But the tv was already on and the remote is at least....oohh...... 3 feet away.
	Line 2751: [2013-01-07 09:01:14] <Cosmo_> Anyway, back to audacity
	Line 2797: [2013-01-07 09:12:18] <Cosmo_> It changed after midnight (i'm on the GMT)
	Line 2805: [2013-01-07 09:13:30] <Cosmo_> I wonder if there'll ever be anything that points to a location rather than an answer
	Line 2807: [2013-01-07 09:13:45] <Cosmo_> if it's all around, we should be able to see or experience it somewhere
	Line 2818: [2013-01-07 09:14:43] <Cosmo_> or 3301, all around you
	Line 2827: [2013-01-07 09:15:37] <Cosmo_> Remember who we're dealing with, i don't know if they'd leave anything default
	Line 2854: [2013-01-07 09:23:07] <Cosmo_> Well....yeah
	Line 2857: [2013-01-07 09:24:28] <Cosmo_> They're all looking at the stuff coming from the twitter. That's all dutch to me so I'm tearing the mp3 to pieces.
	Line 2955: [2013-01-07 09:54:40] <Cosmo_> Exciting, nice job guys!
	Line 2966: [2013-01-07 09:57:40] <Cosmo_> Just googling around with what we have, gonna trawl this, see if there's any clues
	Line 2967: [2013-01-07 09:57:41] <Cosmo_> http://www.erolsadiku.com/DOWNLOAD/FREEMASONRY%20%28SLOBODNO%20ZIDARSTVO%29/Books-3/Gematria%2C%20A%20Preliminary%20Investigation%20of%20the%20Cabala.pdf
	Line 2974: [2013-01-07 10:00:01] <Cosmo_> Why are we only getting a chart of prime numbers anyway?
	Line 2978: [2013-01-07 10:02:00] <Cosmo_> The symbols in the gematria don't match 3301's table either.
	Line 2981: [2013-01-07 10:02:30] <Ymgve> Cosmo_: Gematria or gimatria (Hebrew: ??????? gema?riya) is a system of assigning numerical value to a word or phrase
	Line 2984: [2013-01-07 10:03:30] <Cosmo_> Ymgve: I'm literally just learning all of this . I'll keep my mouth shut untill I've learnt more.
	Line 2986: [2013-01-07 10:03:44] <Cosmo_> Maybe, I'm scanning
	Line 3012: [2013-01-07 10:11:07] <Cosmo_> I wonder if the next thing will use these symbols instead of numbers and letters.
	Line 3243: [2013-01-07 10:50:29] <Cosmo_> Holy. Shit
	Line 3248: [2013-01-07 10:52:12] <Cosmo_> 'revealed' through 3301
	Line 3249: [2013-01-07 10:52:20] <Cosmo_> Strange word to use
	Line 3259: [2013-01-07 10:54:36] <Cosmo_> You mean 'hired'? ;)
	Line 3261: [2013-01-07 10:55:17] <Cosmo_> ....Are you a wizarD?
	Line 3265: [2013-01-07 10:55:27] <scrounger> Cosmo_, read chapter 2 line 55 of book of the law
	Line 3266: [2013-01-07 10:56:05] <Cosmo_> I've read it. Now forgive me while I look blankly at the screen.
	Line 3289: [2013-01-07 11:02:02] <Cosmo_> There's another image?
	Line 3302: [2013-01-07 11:05:35] <Cosmo_> So it leaves the question, what's next?
	Line 3309: [2013-01-07 11:06:24] <Cosmo_> That's how it looks.
	Line 3319: [2013-01-07 11:07:47] <Cosmo_> Also need to see how it connects back to the clues from earlier. The parable has been forgotten
	Line 3322: [2013-01-07 11:08:06] <Cosmo_> Ymgve is a wizard of information. Fact.
	Line 3389: [2013-01-07 11:16:46] <Cosmo_> Hahahaa, i didn't notice the little cicada symbol at the bottom, nice
	Line 3417: [2013-01-07 11:19:12] <Cosmo_> ^
	Line 3479: [2013-01-07 11:25:32] <Cosmo_> I've looked at the song a lot. disregard any idea that it's palindromic
	Line 3481: [2013-01-07 11:25:48] <Cosmo_> the bpm changes between 135, 145 and 125
	Line 3485: [2013-01-07 11:25:59] <andorraclaim> Cosmo_: thanks
	Line 3488: [2013-01-07 11:26:12] <Cosmo_> and the reversed sections of the song are just a reversed guitar sliding on one string
	Line 3505: [2013-01-07 11:26:51] <Cosmo_> Lemme just go check the chords
	Line 3506: [2013-01-07 11:27:11] <Cosmo_> Oh god dammit i don't have my guitar
	Line 3508: [2013-01-07 11:27:21] <Cosmo_> ......... It's in drop D
	Line 3511: [2013-01-07 11:27:28] <Cosmo_> No the mp3 was important
	Line 3521: [2013-01-07 11:28:21] <Cosmo_> Music isn't all around you. Not compared to things like 'life' or 'information' or pseudo-deep shit like that
	Line 3523: [2013-01-07 11:28:41] <Cosmo_> The mp3 itself was important
	Line 3525: [2013-01-07 11:28:57] <Cosmo_> the music......meh, maybe later, but as of yet I've found nothing in there
	Line 3530: [2013-01-07 11:29:36] <Cosmo_> Oh I isolated the 'breath' sound at the start too, i'm actually pretty sure it's the sound of a group of cicadas
	Line 3538: [2013-01-07 11:30:19] <Cosmo_> Depends what you count as interesting.
	Line 3557: [2013-01-07 11:32:05] <Cosmo_> The  reversed music at the end is not in the same key as the rest of the song, the song was one guitar recorded by two microphones, the drums at the end are only one bass drum heavily edited.
	Line 3559: [2013-01-07 11:32:19] <Cosmo_> Hahahaa!! Amazing
	Line 3570: [2013-01-07 11:35:39] <Cosmo_> Style? Hard to say. Elements or country, classical.
	Line 3579: [2013-01-07 11:36:59] <scrounger> Cosmo: so if you were going to sum it up to a deaf person, what would you say?
	Line 3588: [2013-01-07 11:37:27] <Cosmo_> it has almost a drone bass note. What gets to me most about the song is this. It's a bad recording. As in it's been very badly recorded with what sounds like piss-poo equipment even for a bedroom set up. But it's very specifically edited.
	Line 3590: [2013-01-07 11:37:33] <Cosmo_> A cajon? Nah they're much higher

	Line 3602: [2013-01-07 11:39:06] <Cosmo_> I'm about to go to university. I won't be able to do anything other than run the mp3 through some much more advanced sound software.
	Line 3617: [2013-01-07 11:39:36] <Cosmo_> I assume I'll come up with nothing, but hey
	Line 3647: [2013-01-07 11:42:50] <Cosmo_> andorraclaim: I've been exploring that idea as best I can. I'm going to try a couple more things out with it, see if i can't create an image out of it. But don't get bogged down on it, these guys are moving forwards, keep up with them, I highly doubt the mp3 is going to get any more useful than it's already been
	Line 3655: [2013-01-07 11:44:15] <andorraclaim> Cosmo_: i agree as well, i just can't help outside of this currently and this keeps ringing in my head "Web browsers are useless here."
	Line 3694: [2013-01-07 11:46:12] <Cosmo_> andorraclaim: I become useless where they're going. I'm just constantly aware we're moving further and further away from what the clues were to begin with. I'll be keeping track, but for now, I'm off to uni to strip these older clues back to shreds

	Line 4343: [2013-01-07 12:33:14] <Cosmo_> A countdown or a time limit, hopefully the former
	Line 4361: [2013-01-07 12:34:35] <Cosmo_> It is finished, someone managed to predict the rest of it
	Line 4365: [2013-01-07 12:35:01] <scrounger> and how did that magical shit happen, Cosmo_? that confuse dthe fuck out of me actually
	Line 4366: [2013-01-07 12:35:26] <Cosmo_> Yep, so he finished the image, then (And I might be wrong here) found the rest of the code just repeated 3301 over and over
	Line 4367: [2013-01-07 12:35:26] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, it's still dumping

	Line 4402: [2013-01-07 12:40:09] <Cosmo_> verily my vichisoirre of verbiage is impossible to convert into runes. How does cicada miss a letter by accident?

	Line 4526: [2013-01-07 12:57:13] <Cosmo_> Yeah the spaces and tabs were used to find the onion link i think.

	Line 4649: [2013-01-07 13:10:50] <Cosmo_> He said something about it coming in 2 halves, but the second half being redundant
