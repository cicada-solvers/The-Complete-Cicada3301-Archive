[05:28am] brotherBox: ext, I extracted and outguessed it.
[05:28am] parardhes: is an image
[05:28am] brotherBox: Its a few hexdumps which look like jpgs and possibly a book cipher.

[05:41am] brotherBox: The infotomb is itdentical to the original one, just to have that off the list.


pcman3301: Yes Trio Sonata #2.  Book will be GEB (by DH).  I don't have my copy to hand.
[05:46am]

onecool: and the equation image
[05:46am] PersonalKilljoy: i got single bzip2 archive
[05:46am] brotherBox: ^
[05:46am] ext: silence_: it is bzip compressed
[05:46am] PersonalKilljoy: which is damaged........
[05:46am] onecool: looks like it is referring to the fisher equation

[05:52am] pcman3301: Bew means provable.  Equation is Goedel incompleteness theorem, hence why the book is GEB
[05:53am] pcman3301: "Bew(y) = ? x ( y is the G?del number ofy a formula and x is the G?del number of a proof of the formula encoded by y)."

parardhes: the book seems to be GEB by Douglas Hofstadter, but 13:10:1 dont work, we have to find out AMO:13:10:1
[06:19am] ext: http://dump.sidvind.com/cicada_2004_onion5_2/7/
[06:20am] iII: Lurker, good call last year on this coming around to hofstadter
[06:20am]

onecool: the letters in the outguess correspond to parables

i got the canon names correctly
[06:26am] onecool: but i found that CFAF:5:23:6                Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud 177
[06:26am] scelsi: is re:  godel escher bach there's a book by douglas hofstader of that name
[06:26am] scelsi: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach
[06:26am] onecool: it's not line/word/character for that one i dont think
[06:27am] scelsi: all about strange loops
[06:27am] scelsi: and algorithms
[06:27am] ss23: GEB has to be the most fucking horrible book they could've picked for this
[06:27am]

earlier hints on onion 5 


akame: so you remember the matrix jpeg page 4? it had no passless outguess
[12:04am] akame: when you run outguess
[12:04am] akame: it says data length 58152
[12:04am] akame: familiar?
[12:05am] akame: now outguess says iextracted data length too long
[12:05am] akame: so i modified the outguess source code
[12:05am] akame: to dump the data buffer
[12:05am] akame: the first 4 bytes match the new onion jpg outguessses!!!
akame: p4 matrix jpg forced outguess with bytelength 58152: https://infotomb.com/pnid9
[12:18am]
concise summary:
https://infotomb.com/xgh2q fwiw
any outguess key on new onioin 4 images and old p4 produces same seed and length
[03:20am] akame: so does it mean they have the same key?

/* you can run jpaeger.py with filename as argument, it will append number and jpg to each output file.  this save having to rename file --teefs */
 there was no OOB data in between the 4 images

in o4.3.jpg: outguess is ASCII: see below
the other 3 are exactly 58152 bytes long
nazgul: I have already XORed the 58152 bytes outguesses of the onion4 images 00,01 and 03, nothing useful

3 non-ascii outguesses

Eve57: I checked 98 combinations of the three outguesses and the three 256 byte strings.
[05:39am] ext: there is a large portion of the beginning that is similar
[05:40am]

nazgul: My filenames are following the extraction routine as detailed in http://pastebin.com/A0dWX1Qi
nazgul: I am looking for any file headers in the onion4 outguesses (exept the ASCII that gave us onion5). No useable (as in images/text/compressed data/mp3) file headers found in onion4.image00.outguess (58152 bytes)
nazgul: No useable (as in images/text/compressed data/mp3) file headers found in onion4.image01.outguess (58152 bytes)
nazgul: No useable (as in images/text/compressed data/mp3) file headers found in onion4.image03.outguess (58152 bytes)
nazgul: No useable file headers (for images/text/compressed data/mp3) found in onion4.image00.jpg (823807 bytes) XORed with any of the 256 byte strings or their byte-order reversed copies at all possible offsets. Minimum entropy is 6.89

Nothing of interest found, only binary data.

XORed all three 58152 byte non ascii outguesses from onion4 with the onion5.mp3 at all possible offsets. I scanned for file headers but found no readable files. The minimum entropy is around 7.9 in all cases.

An extensive analysis of the three non-ASCII outguesses in combination with the three 256 byte strings from onions 2,3 and 4 can be found at http://pastebin.com/vkaf3KWY

onecool: [00:40] <onecool> if onion address is 16 characters + '.' + 5(onion)
[06:53am] onecool: [00:40] <onecool> 22 characters total
[06:57am]

strings are identical from 0 upto byte 1571 (prime), then for 22 bytes 1 and 2 are identical then for another 22 bytes all 3 identical, tand from then on all seems random
tried all ways possible to get these 22 bytes to decipher to an onion (16 + . + onion) seemed such a sweet idea - but found nothing

[02:52am] Eve57: <Eve57>That is an OCR software that can learn new alphabets on the fly.
[02:52am] Eve57: <Eve57>Whenever there is a unknown symbol it will ask as what it should be recognized.
[02:52am] Eve57: <Eve57>Or you can even manually build a database - just a directory with images and a text file that contains the mapping file - symbol.

[02:56am] Eve57: And I removed the border around the text manually.

file called interconnectedness
[02:11am] poincare__: http://dump.sidvind.com/onion5.mp3 - ha! code in guitar?

interconnectedness, an mp3 file

A mirror of the song is here on Youtube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ActGqDxBD4A

SheCalledMePaul: its in D minor, and DADGAD tuning btw if that helps you [03:27am]
austintrigue: that last refrain from the guitar is being played backwards[03:12am] SheCalledMePaul: there was backwards guitarplaying in 761.mp3 as well[03:12am]
counterhash: Playing the two mp3s on top of each other in Audacity produces nothing of interesct [06:17am]
modusponies: for those focusing on the audio, you can do a lot more beyond a spectrogram  http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/link/9943
length of song is 277.133 seconds. 277133 is prime
snibbib: also, song is 277 seconds long. the title "Interconnectedness" adds up to 772 in the gematria [06:12am]
zoanthall: i've tried mp3stegz and mp3stego, no dice
high freq cutoff checked - PersonalKilljoy: http://i.imgur.com/eXNLU1h.jpg
the size of the mp3 is 665187 bytes = 2 * 3325937

counterhash: Anyone know why we have all of the 55s at the end for padding? Is it a normal LAME function or?[06:45am] 
Mothwing: No, that's not normal in LAME, look at the other mp3s we've received as hex text, they were all encoded with LAME too.

unused cues on the way:
9133 was redundant end after onion 5 in deciphered outguess text
instruction on page 4 of onion 4 images: 
9133 is prime, so is 3319
 277133 is also prime (length of mp3)
amone: do four things unreasonable each day has a gematria value of 1429 which is a prime
[03:08am] amone: 14293319 is also a prime
