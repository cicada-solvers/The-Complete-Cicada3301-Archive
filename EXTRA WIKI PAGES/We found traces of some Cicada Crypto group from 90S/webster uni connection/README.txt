Finally this public log was recorded by Webster University regarding on how cicada.berkeley.edu was used in relations of keeping them anonymous 
(http://www.websteruniv.edu/~bumbaugh/net/net-anon.pt1). As a result, 
it seems that cicada.berkeley.edu distros appear to have built the earliest forms of encryption and 
anonymity in relations of using the Internet as a form of communication and information transferring. As a result, it ties closely to the MO of how Cicada 3301 
does things in relations to their puzzles thus far.
