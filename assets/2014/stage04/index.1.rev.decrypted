It is through this pilgrimage that we shape ourselves and our realities.
Journey deep within and you will arrive outside.
Like the instar, it is only through going within that the may emerge!

Widsom!
You are a being unto yourself.
You are a law unto yourself.
Each intelligence is holy.
For all that lives is holy.
